We already saw in\nSection 7.4.1 how storing the more numerous 3D point parameters before the camera param-\neters and using the Schur complement (7.56) results in a more efﬁcient algorithm. Similarly,\nsorting parameters by time in video-based reconstruction problems usually results in lower\nﬁll-in. Furthermore, any problem whose adjacency graph (the graph corresponding to the\nsparsity pattern) is a tree can be solved in linear time with an appropriate reordering of the\nvariables (putting all the children before their parents). All of these are examples of good\nreordering techniques.\nIn the general case of unstructured data, there are many heuristics available to ﬁnd good\nreorderings (Bj¨orck 1996; Davis 2006).8 For general adjacency (sparsity) graphs, minimum\ndegree orderings generally produce good results. For planar graphs, which often arise on im-\nage or spline grids (Section 8.3), nested dissection, which recursively splits the graph into two\nequal halves along a frontier (or boundary) of small size, generally works well. Such domain\ndecomposition (or multi-frontal) techniques also enable the use of parallel processing, since\nindependent sub-graphs can be processed in parallel on separate processors (Davis 2008).\nThe overall set of steps used to perform the direct solution of sparse least squares problems\nare summarized in Algorithm A.2, which is a modiﬁed version of Algorithm 6.6.1 by Bj¨orck\n(1996, Section 6.6)). If a series of related least squares problems is being solved, as is the\ncase in iterative non-linear least squares (Appendix A.3), steps 1–3 can be performed ahead of\ntime and reused for each new invocation with different C and d values. When the problem is\nblock-structured, as is the case in structure from motion where point (structure) variables have\ndense 3×3 sub-entries in C and cameras have 6×6 (or larger) entries, the cost of performing\nthe reordering computation is small compared to the actual numerical factorization, which\ncan beneﬁt from block-structured matrix operations (Golub and Van Loan 1996). It is also\npossible to apply sparse reordering and multifrontal techniques to QR factorization (Davis\n2008), which may be preferable when the least squares problems are poorly conditioned.\nA.5 Iterative techniques\nWhen problems become large, the amount of memory required to store the Hessian matrix\nC and its factor R, and the amount of time it takes to compute the factorization, can be-\ncome prohibitively large, especially when there are large amounts of ﬁll-in. This is often\n8Finding the optimal reordering with minimal ﬁll-in is provably NP-hard.\nA.5 Iterative techniques\n749\nprocedure SparseCholeskySolve(C, d):\n1.

These are described in\nspecialized textbooks on iterative solution techniques (Axelsson 1996; Saad 2003) as well as\nin more general books on numerical linear algebra and least squares techniques (Bj¨orck 1996;\nGolub and Van Loan 1996; Trefethen and Bau 1997; Nocedal and Wright 2006; Bj¨orck and\nDahlquist 2010).\nA.5.1 Conjugate gradient\nThe iterative solution technique that often performs best is conjugate gradient descent, which\ntakes a series of downhill steps that are conjugate to each other with respect to the C matrix,\n750\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\ni.e., if the u and v descent directions satisfy uT Cv = 0. In practice, conjugate gradient\ndescent outperforms other kinds of gradient descent algorithm because its convergence rate\nis proportional to the square root of the condition number of C instead of the condition\nnumber itself.9 Shewchuk (1994) provides a nice introduction to this topic, with clear intuitive\nexplanations of the reasoning behind the conjugate gradient algorithm and its performance.\nAlgorithm A.3 describes the conjugate gradient algorithm and its related least squares\ncounterpart, which can be used when the original set of least squares linear equations are\navailable in the form of Ax = b (A.28). While it is easy to convince yourself that the two\nforms are mathematically equivalent, the least squares form is preferable if rounding errors\nstart to affect the results because of poor conditioning. It may also be preferable if, due to\nthe sparsity structure of A, multiplies with the original A matrix are faster or more space\nefﬁcient than multiplies with C.\nThe conjugate gradient algorithm starts by computing the current residual r0 = d−Cx0,\nwhich is the direction of steepest descent of the energy function (A.28). It sets the original\ndescent direction p0 = r0. Next, it multiplies the descent direction by the quadratic form\n(Hessian) matrix C and combines this with the residual to estimate the optimal step size αk.\nThe solution vector xk and the residual vector rk are then updated using this step size. (No-\ntice how the least squares variant of the conjugate gradient algorithm splits the multiplication\nby the C = AT A matrix across steps 4 and 8.) Finally, a new search direction is calculated\nby ﬁrst computing a factor β as the ratio of current to previous residual magnitudes. The\nnew search direction pk+1 is then set to the residual plus β times the old search direction pk,\nwhich keeps the directions conjugate with respect to C.\nIt turns out that conjugate gradient descent can also be directly applied to non-quadratic\nenergy functions, e.g., those arising from non-linear least squares (Appendix A.3). Instead\nof explicitly forming a local quadratic approximation C and then computing residuals rk,\nnon-linear conjugate gradient descent computes the gradient of the energy function E (A.45)\ndirectly inside each iteration and uses it to set the search direction (Nocedal and Wright 2006).\nSince the quadratic approximation to the energy function may not exist or may be inaccurate,\nline search is often used to determine the step size αk. Furthermore, to compensate for errors\nin ﬁnding the true function minimum, alternative formulas for βk+1 such as Polak–Ribi`ere,\nβk+1 = ∇E(xk+1)[∇E(xk+1) −∇E(xk)]\n∥∇E(xk)∥2\n(A.51)\nare often used (Nocedal and Wright 2006).\n9 The condition number κ(C) is the ratio of the largest and smallest eigenvalues of C. The actual convergence\nrate depends on the clustering of the eigenvalues, as discussed in the references cited in this section.",
