Around the same time, Geman and Geman (1984)\npointed out that such problems could equally well be formulated using discrete Markov Ran-\ndom Field (MRF) models (see Section 3.7.2), which enabled the use of better (global) search\nand optimization algorithms, such as simulated annealing.\nOnline variants of MRF algorithms that modeled and updated uncertainties using the\nKalman ﬁlter were introduced a little later (Dickmanns and Graefe 1988; Matthies, Kanade,\nand Szeliski 1989; Szeliski 1989). Attempts were also made to map both regularized and\nMRF algorithms onto parallel hardware (Poggio and Koch 1985; Poggio, Little, Gamble\net al. 1988; Fischler, Firschein, Barnard et al. 1989). The book by Fischler and Firschein\n(1987) contains a nice collection of articles focusing on all of these topics (stereo, ﬂow,\nregularization, MRFs, and even higher-level vision).\nThree-dimensional range data processing (acquisition, merging, modeling, and recogni-\ntion; see Figure 1.8f) continued being actively explored during this decade (Agin and Binford\n1976; Besl and Jain 1985; Faugeras and Hebert 1987; Curless and Levoy 1996). The compi-\nlation by Kanade (1987) contains a lot of the interesting papers in this area.\n1990s.\nWhile a lot of the previously mentioned topics continued to be explored, a few of\nthem became signiﬁcantly more active.\nA burst of activity in using projective invariants for recognition (Mundy and Zisserman\n1992) evolved into a concerted effort to solve the structure from motion problem (see Chap-\nter 7). A lot of the initial activity was directed at projective reconstructions, which did not\nrequire knowledge of camera calibration (Faugeras 1992; Hartley, Gupta, and Chang 1992;\nHartley 1994a; Faugeras and Luong 2001; Hartley and Zisserman 2004). Simultaneously, fac-\ntorization techniques (Section 7.3) were developed to solve efﬁciently problems for which or-\nthographic camera approximations were applicable (Figure 1.9a) (Tomasi and Kanade 1992;\nPoelman and Kanade 1997; Anandan and Irani 2002) and then later extended to the perspec-\ntive case (Christy and Horaud 1996; Triggs 1996). Eventually, the ﬁeld started using full\nglobal optimization (see Section 7.4 and Taylor, Kriegman, and Anandan 1991; Szeliski and\nKang 1994; Azarbayejani and Pentland 1995), which was later recognized as being the same\nas the bundle adjustment techniques traditionally used in photogrammetry (Triggs, McLauch-\nlan, Hartley et al. 1999). Fully automated (sparse) 3D modeling systems were built using such\ntechniques (Beardsley, Torr, and Zisserman 1996; Schaffalitzky and Zisserman 2002; Brown\nand Lowe 2003; Snavely, Seitz, and Szeliski 2006).\nWork begun in the 1980s on using detailed measurements of color and intensity combined\n16\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 1.9 Examples of computer vision algorithms from the 1990s: (a) factorization-based\nstructure from motion (Tomasi and Kanade 1992) c⃝1992 Springer, (b) dense stereo match-\ning (Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih 2001), (c) multi-view reconstruction (Seitz and Dyer 1999)\nc⃝1999 Springer, (d) face tracking (Matthews, Xiao, and Baker 2007), (e) image segmenta-\ntion (Belongie, Fowlkes, Chung et al. 2002) c⃝2002 Springer, (f) face recognition (Turk and\nPentland 1991a).\nwith accurate physical models of radiance transport and color image formation created its own\nsubﬁeld known as physics-based vision. A good survey of the ﬁeld can be found in the three-\nvolume collection on this topic (Wolff, Shafer, and Healey 1992a; Healey and Shafer 1992;\nShafer, Healey, and Wolff 1992).\nOptical ﬂow methods (see Chapter 8) continued to be improved (Nagel and Enkelmann\n1986; Bolles, Baker, and Marimont 1987; Horn and Weldon Jr. 1988; Anandan 1989; Bergen,\nAnandan, Hanna et al. 1992; Black and Anandan 1996; Bruhn, Weickert, and Schn¨orr 2005;\nPapenberg, Bruhn, Brox et al. 2006), with (Nagel 1986; Barron, Fleet, and Beauchemin 1994;\nBaker, Black, Lewis et al. 2007) being good surveys. Similarly, a lot of progress was made\non dense stereo correspondence algorithms (see Chapter 11, Okutomi and Kanade (1993,\n1994); Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih (1998); Birchﬁeld and Tomasi (1999); Boykov, Veksler,\nand Zabih (2001), and the survey and comparison in Scharstein and Szeliski (2002)), with\nthe biggest breakthrough being perhaps global optimization using graph cut techniques (Fig-\nure 1.9b) (Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih 2001).\n1.2 A brief history\n17\nMulti-view stereo algorithms (Figure 1.9c) that produce complete 3D surfaces (see Sec-\ntion 11.6) were also an active topic of research (Seitz and Dyer 1999; Kutulakos and Seitz\n2000) that continues to be active today (Seitz, Curless, Diebel et al. 2006). Techniques for\nproducing 3D volumetric descriptions from binary silhouettes (see Section 11.6.2) continued\nto be developed (Potmesil 1987; Srivasan, Liang, and Hackwood 1990; Szeliski 1993; Lau-\nrentini 1994), along with techniques based on tracking and reconstructing smooth occluding\ncontours (see Section 11.2.1 and Cipolla and Blake 1992; Vaillant and Faugeras 1992; Zheng\n1994; Boyer and Berger 1997; Szeliski and Weiss 1998; Cipolla and Giblin 2000).\nTracking algorithms also improved a lot, including contour tracking using active contours\n(see Section 5.1), such as snakes (Kass, Witkin, and Terzopoulos 1988), particle ﬁlters (Blake\nand Isard 1998), and level sets (Malladi, Sethian, and Vemuri 1995), as well as intensity-based\n(direct) techniques (Lucas and Kanade 1981; Shi and Tomasi 1994; Rehg and Kanade 1994),\noften applied to tracking faces (Figure 1.9d) (Lanitis, Taylor, and Cootes 1997; Matthews and\nBaker 2004; Matthews, Xiao, and Baker 2007) and whole bodies (Sidenbladh, Black, and\nFleet 2000; Hilton, Fua, and Ronfard 2006; Moeslund, Hilton, and Kr¨uger 2006).\nImage segmentation (see Chapter 5) (Figure 1.9e), a topic which has been active since\nthe earliest days of computer vision (Brice and Fennema 1970; Horowitz and Pavlidis 1976;\nRiseman and Arbib 1977; Rosenfeld and Davis 1979; Haralick and Shapiro 1985; Pavlidis\nand Liow 1990), was also an active topic of research, producing techniques based on min-\nimum energy (Mumford and Shah 1989) and minimum description length (Leclerc 1989),\nnormalized cuts (Shi and Malik 2000), and mean shift (Comaniciu and Meer 2002).\nStatistical learning techniques started appearing, ﬁrst in the application of principal com-\nponent eigenface analysis to face recognition (Figure 1.9f) (see Section 14.2.1 and Turk and\nPentland 1991a) and linear dynamical systems for curve tracking (see Section 5.1.1 and Blake\nand Isard 1998).\nPerhaps the most notable development in computer vision during this decade was the\nincreased interaction with computer graphics (Seitz and Szeliski 1999), especially in the\ncross-disciplinary area of image-based modeling and rendering (see Chapter 13). The idea of\nmanipulating real-world imagery directly to create new animations ﬁrst came to prominence\nwith image morphing techniques (Figure1.5c) (see Section 3.6.3 and Beier and Neely 1992)\nand was later applied to view interpolation (Chen and Williams 1993; Seitz and Dyer 1996),\npanoramic image stitching (Figure1.5a) (see Chapter 9 and Mann and Picard 1994; Chen\n1995; Szeliski 1996; Szeliski and Shum 1997; Szeliski 2006a), and full light-ﬁeld rendering\n(Figure 1.10a) (see Section 13.3 and Gortler, Grzeszczuk, Szeliski et al. 1996; Levoy and\nHanrahan 1996; Shade, Gortler, He et al. 1998). At the same time, image-based modeling\ntechniques (Figure 1.10b) for automatically creating realistic 3D models from collections of\nimages were also being introduced (Beardsley, Torr, and Zisserman 1996; Debevec, Taylor,\nand Malik 1996; Taylor, Debevec, and Malik 1996).",
