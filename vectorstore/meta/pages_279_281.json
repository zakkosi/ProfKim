Some results of\nsuch vanishing point detection algorithms can be seen in Figure 4.45.\n4.3.4 Application: Rectangle detection\nOnce sets of mutually orthogonal vanishing points have been detected, it now becomes pos-\nsible to search for 3D rectangular structures in the image (Figure 4.47). Over the last decade,\na variety of techniques have been developed to ﬁnd such rectangles, primarily focused on\narchitectural scenes (Koˇseck´a and Zhang 2005; Han and Zhu 2005; Shaw and Barnes 2006;\nMiˇcuˇs`ık, Wildenauer, and Koˇseck´a 2008; Schindler, Krishnamurthy, Lublinerman et al. 2008).\nAfter detecting orthogonal vanishing directions, Koˇseck´a and Zhang (2005) reﬁne the\nﬁtted line equations, search for corners near line intersections, and then verify rectangle hy-\npotheses by rectifying the corresponding patches and looking for a preponderance of hori-\nzontal and vertical edges (Figures 4.47a–b). In follow-on work, Miˇcuˇs`ık, Wildenauer, and\nKoˇseck´a (2008) use a Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) to disambiguate between potentially over-\nlapping rectangle hypotheses. They also use a plane sweep algorithm to match rectangles\nbetween different views (Figures 4.47d–f).\nA different approach is proposed by Han and Zhu (2005), who use a grammar of potential\nrectangle shapes and nesting structures (between rectangles and vanishing points) to infer the\nmost likely assignment of line segments to rectangles (Figure 4.47c).\n4.4 Additional reading\nOne of the seminal papers on feature detection, description, and matching is by Lowe (2004).\nComprehensive surveys and evaluations of such techniques have been made by Schmid,\nMohr, and Bauckhage (2000); Mikolajczyk and Schmid (2005); Mikolajczyk, Tuytelaars,\nSchmid et al. (2005); Tuytelaars and Mikolajczyk (2007) while Shi and Tomasi (1994) and\nTriggs (2004) also provide nice reviews.\nIn the area of feature detectors (Mikolajczyk, Tuytelaars, Schmid et al. 2005), in addition\nto such classic approaches as F¨orstner–Harris (F¨orstner 1986; Harris and Stephens 1988) and\ndifference of Gaussians (Lindeberg 1993, 1998b; Lowe 2004), maximally stable extremal re-\ngions (MSERs) are widely used for applications that require afﬁne invariance (Matas, Chum,\n258\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 4.47 Rectangle detection: (a) indoor corridor and (b) building exterior with grouped\nfacades (Koˇseck´a and Zhang 2005) c⃝2005 Elsevier; (c) grammar-based recognition (Han\nand Zhu 2005) c⃝2005 IEEE; (d–f) rectangle matching using a plane sweep algorithm\n(Miˇcuˇs`ık, Wildenauer, and Koˇseck´a 2008) c⃝2008 IEEE.\nUrban et al. 2004; Nist´er and Stew´enius 2008). More recent interest point detectors are\ndiscussed by Xiao and Shah (2003); Koethe (2003); Carneiro and Jepson (2005); Kenney,\nZuliani, and Manjunath (2005); Bay, Tuytelaars, and Van Gool (2006); Platel, Balmachnova,\nFlorack et al. (2006); Rosten and Drummond (2006), as well as techniques based on line\nmatching (Zoghlami, Faugeras, and Deriche 1997; Bartoli, Coquerelle, and Sturm 2004) and\nregion detection (Kadir, Zisserman, and Brady 2004; Matas, Chum, Urban et al. 2004; Tuyte-\nlaars and Van Gool 2004; Corso and Hager 2005).\nA variety of local feature descriptors (and matching heuristics) are surveyed and com-\npared by Mikolajczyk and Schmid (2005). More recent publications in this area include\nthose by van de Weijer and Schmid (2006); Abdel-Hakim and Farag (2006); Winder and\nBrown (2007); Hua, Brown, and Winder (2007). Techniques for efﬁciently matching features\ninclude k-d trees (Beis and Lowe 1999; Lowe 2004; Muja and Lowe 2009), pyramid match-\ning kernels (Grauman and Darrell 2005), metric (vocabulary) trees (Nist´er and Stew´enius\n2006), and a variety of multi-dimensional hashing techniques (Shakhnarovich, Viola, and\nDarrell 2003; Torralba, Weiss, and Fergus 2008; Weiss, Torralba, and Fergus 2008; Kulis and\n4.5 Exercises\n259\nGrauman 2009; Raginsky and Lazebnik 2009).\nThe classic reference on feature detection and tracking is (Shi and Tomasi 1994). More\nrecent work in this ﬁeld has focused on learning better matching functions for speciﬁc features\n(Avidan 2001; Jurie and Dhome 2002; Williams, Blake, and Cipolla 2003; Lepetit and Fua\n2005; Lepetit, Pilet, and Fua 2006; Hinterstoisser, Benhimane, Navab et al. 2008; Rogez,\nRihan, Ramalingam et al. 2008; ¨Ozuysal, Calonder, Lepetit et al. 2010).\nA highly cited and widely used edge detector is the one developed by Canny (1986).\nAlternative edge detectors as well as experimental comparisons can be found in publica-\ntions by Nalwa and Binford (1986); Nalwa (1987); Deriche (1987); Freeman and Adelson\n(1991); Nalwa (1993); Heath, Sarkar, Sanocki et al. (1998); Crane (1997); Ritter and Wilson\n(2000); Bowyer, Kranenburg, and Dougherty (2001); Arbel´aez, Maire, Fowlkes et al. (2010).\nThe topic of scale selection in edge detection is nicely treated by Elder and Zucker (1998),\nwhile approaches to color and texture edge detection can be found in (Ruzon and Tomasi\n2001; Martin, Fowlkes, and Malik 2004; Gevers, van de Weijer, and Stokman 2006). Edge\ndetectors have also recently been combined with region segmentation techniques to further\nimprove the detection of semantically salient boundaries (Maire, Arbelaez, Fowlkes et al.\n2008; Arbel´aez, Maire, Fowlkes et al. 2010). Edges linked into contours can be smoothed\nand manipulated for artistic effect (Lowe 1989; Finkelstein and Salesin 1994; Taubin 1995)\nand used for recognition (Belongie, Malik, and Puzicha 2002; Tek and Kimia 2003; Sebastian\nand Kimia 2005).\nAn early, well-regarded paper on straight line extraction in images was written by Burns,\nHanson, and Riseman (1986). More recent techniques often combine line detection with van-\nishing point detection (Quan and Mohr 1989; Collins and Weiss 1990; Brillaut-O’Mahoney\n1991; McLean and Kotturi 1995; Becker and Bove 1995; Shufelt 1999; Tuytelaars, Van Gool,\nand Proesmans 1997; Schaffalitzky and Zisserman 2000; Antone and Teller 2002; Rother\n2002; Koˇseck´a and Zhang 2005; Pﬂugfelder 2008; Sinha, Steedly, Szeliski et al. 2008; Tardif\n2009).\n4.5 Exercises\nEx 4.1: Interest point detector\nImplement one or more keypoint detectors and compare\ntheir performance (with your own or with a classmate’s detector).\nPossible detectors:\n• Laplacian or Difference of Gaussian;\n• F¨orstner–Harris Hessian (try different formula variants given in (4.9–4.11));",
