The original images\nwere obtained from ﬂickr (http://www.ﬂickr.com/) and the database rights are explained on\nhttp://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/voc2008/.\n“serious” volunteer effort is the LabelMe database, in which vision researchers contribute\nmanual polygonal region annotations in return for gaining access to the database (Russell,\nTorralba, Murphy et al. 2008).\nThe use of computer vision algorithms for collecting recognition databases dates back to\nthe work of Fergus, Fei-Fei, Perona et al. (2005), who cluster the results returned by Google\nimage search using an extension of PLSA and then select the clusters associated with the\nhighest ranked results. More recent examples of related techniques include the work of Berg\nand Forsyth (2006) and Li and Fei-Fei (2010).\nWhatever methods are used to collect and validate recognition databases, they will con-\ntinue to grow in size, utility, and difﬁculty from year to year. They will also continue to be\nan essential component of research into the recognition and scene understanding problems,\nwhich remain, as always, the grand challenges of computer vision.\n722\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n14.7 Additional reading\nAlthough there are currently no specialized textbooks on image recognition and scene un-\nderstanding, some surveys (Pinz 2005) and collections of papers (Ponce, Hebert, Schmid et\nal. 2006; Dickinson, Leonardis, Schiele et al. 2007) can be found that describe the latest ap-\nproaches. Other good sources of recent research are courses on this topic, such as the ICCV\n2009 short course (Fei-Fei, Fergus, and Torralba 2009) and Antonio Torralba’s more com-\nprehensive MIT course (Torralba 2008). The PASCAL VOC Challenge Web site contains\nworkshop slides that summarize today’s best performing algorithms.\nThe literature on face, pedestrian, car, and other object detection is quite extensive. Sem-\ninal papers in face detection include those by Osuna, Freund, and Girosi (1997), Sung and\nPoggio (1998), Rowley, Baluja, and Kanade (1998a), and Viola and Jones (2004), with Yang,\nKriegman, and Ahuja (2002) providing a comprehensive survey of early work in this ﬁeld.\nMore recent examples include (Heisele, Ho, Wu et al. 2003; Heisele, Serre, and Poggio 2007).\nEarly work in pedestrian and car detection was carried out by Gavrila and Philomin\n(1999), Gavrila (1999), Papageorgiou and Poggio (2000), Mohan, Papageorgiou, and Pog-\ngio (2001), and Schneiderman and Kanade (2004). More recent examples include the work\nof Belongie, Malik, and Puzicha (2002), Mikolajczyk, Schmid, and Zisserman (2004), Dalal\nand Triggs (2005), Leibe, Seemann, and Schiele (2005), Dalal, Triggs, and Schmid (2006),\nOpelt, Pinz, and Zisserman (2006), Torralba (2007), Andriluka, Roth, and Schiele (2008),\nFelzenszwalb, McAllester, and Ramanan (2008), Rogez, Rihan, Ramalingam et al. (2008),\nAndriluka, Roth, and Schiele (2009), Kumar, Zisserman, and H.S.Torr (2009), Doll`ar, Be-\nlongie, and Perona (2010). and Felzenszwalb, Girshick, McAllester et al. (2010).\nWhile some of the earliest approaches to face recognition involved ﬁnding the distinc-\ntive image features and measuring the distances between them (Fischler and Elschlager 1973;\nKanade 1977; Yuille 1991), more recent approaches rely on comparing gray-level images,\noften projected onto lower dimensional subspaces (Turk and Pentland 1991a; Belhumeur,\nHespanha, and Kriegman 1997; Moghaddam and Pentland 1997; Moghaddam, Jebara, and\nPentland 2000; Heisele, Ho, Wu et al. 2003; Heisele, Serre, and Poggio 2007). Additional\ndetails on principal component analysis (PCA) and its Bayesian counterparts can be found in\nAppendix B.1.1 and books and articles on this topic (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2001;\nBishop 2006; Roweis 1998; Tipping and Bishop 1999; Leonardis and Bischof 2000; Vidal,\nMa, and Sastry 2010). The topics of subspace learning, local distance functions, and metric\nlearning are covered by Cai, He, Hu et al. (2007), Frome, Singer, Sha et al. (2007), Guil-\nlaumin, Verbeek, and Schmid (2009), Ramanan and Baker (2009), and Sivic, Everingham,\nand Zisserman (2009). An alternative to directly matching gray-level images or patches is to\nuse non-linear local transforms such as local binary patterns (Ahonen, Hadid, and Pietik¨ainen\n2006; Zhao and Pietik¨ainen 2007; Cao, Yin, Tang et al. 2010).",
