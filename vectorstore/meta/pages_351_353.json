Note that radial distortion\nneeds to be removed from such images before the feature points can be used for calibration.\nby the calibration matrix K and non-linear effects such as radial distortion (Section 6.3.5).\nA less cumbersome but also less accurate calibration can be obtained by waving a pla-\nnar calibration pattern in front of a camera (Figure 6.8b). In this case, the pattern’s pose\nhas (in principle) to be recovered in conjunction with the intrinsics. In this technique, each\ninput image is used to compute a separate homography (6.19–6.23) ˜\nH mapping the plane’s\ncalibration points (Xi, Yi, 0) into image coordinates (xi, yi),\nxi =\n\n\nxi\nyi\n1\n\n∼K\nh\nr0\nr1\nt\ni\n\n\nXi\nYi\n1\n\n∼˜\nHpi,\n(6.49)\nwhere the ri are the ﬁrst two columns of R and ∼indicates equality up to scale. From\nthese, Zhang (2000) shows how to form linear constraints on the nine entries in the B =\nK−T K−1 matrix, from which the calibration matrix K can be recovered using a matrix\nsquare root and inversion. (The matrix B is known as the image of the absolute conic (IAC)\nin projective geometry and is commonly used for camera calibration (Hartley and Zisserman\n2004, Section 7.5).) If only the focal length is being recovered, the even simpler approach of\nusing vanishing points can be used instead.\n6.3.2 Vanishing points\nA common case for calibration that occurs often in practice is when the camera is looking at\na man-made scene with strong extended rectahedral objects such as boxes or room walls. In\nthis case, we can intersect the 2D lines corresponding to 3D parallel lines to compute their\nvanishing points, as described in Section 4.3.3, and use these to determine the intrinsic and\nextrinsic calibration parameters (Caprile and Torre 1990; Becker and Bove 1995; Liebowitz\n330\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nx1\nx0\nx2\nx1\nx0\nx2\nc\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6.9 Calibration from vanishing points: (a) any pair of ﬁnite vanishing points (ˆxi, ˆxj)\ncan be used to estimate the focal length; (b) the orthocenter of the vanishing point triangle\ngives the optical center of the image c.\nand Zisserman 1998; Cipolla, Drummond, and Robertson 1999; Antone and Teller 2002;\nCriminisi, Reid, and Zisserman 2000; Hartley and Zisserman 2004; Pﬂugfelder 2008).\nLet us assume that we have detected two or more orthogonal vanishing points, all of which\nare ﬁnite, i.e., they are not obtained from lines that appear to be parallel in the image plane\n(Figure 6.9a). Let us also assume a simpliﬁed form for the calibration matrix K where only\nthe focal length is unknown (2.59). (It is often safe for rough 3D modeling to assume that\nthe optical center is at the center of the image, that the aspect ratio is 1, and that there is no\nskew.) In this case, the projection equation for the vanishing points can be written as\nˆxi =\n\n\nxi −cx\nyi −cy\nf\n\n∼Rpi = ri,\n(6.50)\nwhere pi corresponds to one of the cardinal directions (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), or (0, 0, 1), and ri\nis the ith column of the rotation matrix R.\nFrom the orthogonality between columns of the rotation matrix, we have\nri · rj ∼(xi −cx)(xj −cy) + (yi −cy)(yj −cy) + f 2 = 0\n(6.51)\nfrom which we can obtain an estimate for f 2. Note that the accuracy of this estimate increases\nas the vanishing points move closer to the center of the image. In other words, it is best to tilt\nthe calibration pattern a decent amount around the 45◦axis, as in Figure 6.9a. Once the focal\nlength f has been determined, the individual columns of R can be estimated by normalizing\nthe left hand side of (6.50) and taking cross products. Alternatively, an SVD of the initial R\nestimate, which is a variant on orthogonal Procrustes (6.32), can be used.\nIf all three vanishing points are visible and ﬁnite in the same image, it is also possible to\nestimate the optical center as the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the three vanishing\npoints (Caprile and Torre 1990; Hartley and Zisserman 2004, Section 7.6) (Figure 6.9b).\n6.3 Geometric intrinsic calibration\n331\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 6.10\nSingle view metrology (Criminisi, Reid, and Zisserman 2000)\nc⃝2000\nSpringer: (a) input image showing the three coordinate axes computed from the two hori-\nzontal vanishing points (which can be determined from the sidings on the shed); (b) a new\nview of the 3D reconstruction.\nIn practice, however, it is more accurate to re-estimate any unknown intrinsic calibration\nparameters using non-linear least squares (6.42).\n6.3.3 Application: Single view metrology\nA fun application of vanishing point estimation and camera calibration is the single view\nmetrology system developed by Criminisi, Reid, and Zisserman (2000). Their system allows\npeople to interactively measure heights and other dimensions as well as to build piecewise-\nplanar 3D models, as shown in Figure 6.10.\nThe ﬁrst step in their system is to identify two orthogonal vanishing points on the ground\nplane and the vanishing point for the vertical direction, which can be done by drawing some\nparallel sets of lines in the image. (Alternatively, automated techniques such as those dis-\ncussed in Section 4.3.3 or by Schaffalitzky and Zisserman (2000) could be used.) The user\nthen marks a few dimensions in the image, such as the height of a reference object, and\nthe system can automatically compute the height of another object. Walls and other planar\nimpostors (geometry) can also be sketched and reconstructed.\nIn the formulation originally developed by Criminisi, Reid, and Zisserman (2000), the\nsystem produces an afﬁne reconstruction, i.e., one that is only known up to a set of indepen-\ndent scaling factors along each axis. A potentially more useful system can be constructed by\nassuming that the camera is calibrated up to an unknown focal length, which can be recov-\nered from orthogonal (ﬁnite) vanishing directions, as we just described in Section 6.3.2. Once\nthis is done, the user can indicate an origin on the ground plane and another point a known\ndistance away. From this, points on the ground plane can be directly projected into 3D and",
