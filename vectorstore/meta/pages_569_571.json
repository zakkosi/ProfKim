In\nthe video processing community, these matching criteria are referred to as the mean-squared\nerror (MSE) and mean absolute difference (MAD) measures; the term displaced frame dif-\nference is also often used (Tekalp 1995).\nMore recently, robust measures (8.2), including truncated quadratics and contaminated\nGaussians, have been proposed (Black and Anandan 1996; Black and Rangarajan 1996;\nScharstein and Szeliski 1998). These measures are useful because they limit the inﬂuence\nof mismatches during aggregation. Vaish, Szeliski, Zitnick et al. (2006) compare a number\nof such robust measures, including a new one based on the entropy of the pixel values at a\nparticular disparity hypothesis (Zitnick, Kang, Uyttendaele et al. 2004), which is particularly\nuseful in multi-view stereo.\nOther traditional matching costs include normalized cross-correlation (8.11) (Hannah\n1974; Bolles, Baker, and Hannah 1993; Evangelidis and Psarakis 2008), which behaves\nsimilarly to sum-of-squared-differences (SSD), and binary matching costs (i.e., match or no\nmatch) (Marr and Poggio 1976), based on binary features such as edges (Baker and Binford\n1981; Grimson 1985) or the sign of the Laplacian (Nishihara 1984). Because of their poor\ndiscriminability, simple binary matching costs are no longer used in dense stereo matching.\nSome costs are insensitive to differences in camera gain or bias, for example gradient-\nbased measures (Seitz 1989; Scharstein 1994), phase and ﬁlter-bank responses (Marr and\nPoggio 1979; Kass 1988; Jenkin, Jepson, and Tsotsos 1991; Jones and Malik 1992), ﬁlters\nthat remove regular or robust (bilaterally ﬁltered) means (Ansar, Castano, and Matthies 2004;\nHirschm¨uller and Scharstein 2009), dense feature descriptor (Tola, Lepetit, and Fua 2010),\nand non-parametric measures such as rank and census transforms (Zabih and Woodﬁll 1994),\nordinal measures (Bhat and Nayar 1998), or entropy (Zitnick, Kang, Uyttendaele et al. 2004;\nZitnick and Kang 2007). The census transform, which converts each pixel inside a moving\nwindow into a bit vector representing which neighbors are above or below the central pixel,\nwas found by Hirschm¨uller and Scharstein (2009) to be quite robust against large-scale, non-\nstationary exposure and illumination changes.\nIt is also possible to correct for differing global camera characteristics by performing\na preprocessing or iterative reﬁnement step that estimates inter-image bias–gain variations\nusing global regression (Gennert 1988), histogram equalization (Cox, Roy, and Hingorani\n1995), or mutual information (Kim, Kolmogorov, and Zabih 2003; Hirschm¨uller 2008). Lo-\ncal, smoothly varying compensation ﬁelds have also been proposed (Strecha, Tuytelaars, and\nVan Gool 2003; Zhang, McMillan, and Yu 2006).\nIn order to compensate for sampling issues, i.e., dramatically different pixel values in\n548\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nhigh-frequency areas, Birchﬁeld and Tomasi (1998) proposed a matching cost that is less sen-\nsitive to shifts in image sampling. Rather than just comparing pixel values shifted by integral\namounts (which may miss a valid match), they compare each pixel in the reference image\nagainst a linearly interpolated function of the other image. More detailed studies of these\nand additional matching costs are explored in (Szeliski and Scharstein 2004; Hirschm¨uller\nand Scharstein 2009). In particular, if you expect there to be signiﬁcant exposure or appear-\nance variation between images that you are matching, some of the more robust measures\nthat performed well in the evaluation by Hirschm¨uller and Scharstein (2009), such as the\ncensus transform (Zabih and Woodﬁll 1994), ordinal measures (Bhat and Nayar 1998), bi-\nlateral subtraction (Ansar, Castano, and Matthies 2004), or hierarchical mutual information\n(Hirschm¨uller 2008), should be used.\n11.4 Local methods\nLocal and window-based methods aggregate the matching cost by summing or averaging\nover a support region in the DSI C(x, y, d).4 A support region can be either two-dimensional\nat a ﬁxed disparity (favoring fronto-parallel surfaces), or three-dimensional in x-y-d space\n(supporting slanted surfaces). Two-dimensional evidence aggregation has been implemented\nusing square windows or Gaussian convolution (traditional), multiple windows anchored at\ndifferent points, i.e., shiftable windows (Arnold 1983; Fusiello, Roberto, and Trucco 1997;\nBobick and Intille 1999), windows with adaptive sizes (Okutomi and Kanade 1992; Kanade\nand Okutomi 1994; Kang, Szeliski, and Chai 2001; Veksler 2001, 2003), windows based on\nconnected components of constant disparity (Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih 1998), or the re-\nsults of color-based segmentation (Yoon and Kweon 2006; Tombari, Mattoccia, Di Stefano\net al. 2008). Three-dimensional support functions that have been proposed include limited\ndisparity difference (Grimson 1985), limited disparity gradient (Pollard, Mayhew, and Frisby\n1985), Prazdny’s coherence principle (Prazdny 1985), and the more recent work (which in-\ncludes visibility and occlusion reasoning) by Zitnick and Kanade (2000).\nAggregation with a ﬁxed support region can be performed using 2D or 3D convolution,\nC(x, y, d) = w(x, y, d) ∗C0(x, y, d),\n(11.6)\nor, in the case of rectangular windows, using efﬁcient moving average box-ﬁlters (Sec-\ntion 3.2.2) (Kanade, Yoshida, Oda et al. 1996; Kimura, Shinbo, Yamaguchi et al. 1999).\nShiftable windows can also be implemented efﬁciently using a separable sliding min-ﬁlter\n(Figure 11.8) (Scharstein and Szeliski 2002, Section 4.2). Selecting among windows of dif-\nferent shapes and sizes can be performed more efﬁciently by ﬁrst computing a summed area\n4 For two recent surveys and comparisons of such techniques, please see the work of Gong, Yang, Wang et al.\n(2007) and Tombari, Mattoccia, Di Stefano et al. (2008).\n11.4 Local methods\n549\nFigure 11.8 Shiftable window (Scharstein and Szeliski 2002) c⃝2002 Springer. The effect\nof trying all 3 × 3 shifted windows around the black pixel is the same as taking the minimum\nmatching score across all centered (non-shifted) windows in the same neighborhood. (For\nclarity, only three of the neighboring shifted windows are shown here.)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 11.9\nAggregation window sizes and weights adapted to image content (Tombari,\nMattoccia, Di Stefano et al. 2008) c⃝2008 IEEE: (a) original image with selected evaluation\npoints; (b) variable windows (Veksler 2003); (c) adaptive weights (Yoon and Kweon 2006);\n(d) segmentation-based (Tombari, Mattoccia, and Di Stefano 2007). Notice how the adaptive\nweights and segmentation-based techniques adapt their support to similarly colored pixels.\ntable (Section 3.2.3, 3.30–3.32) (Veksler 2003). Selecting the right window is important,\nsince windows must be large enough to contain sufﬁcient texture and yet small enough so\nthat they do not straddle depth discontinuities (Figure 11.9). An alternative method for ag-\ngregation is iterative diffusion, i.e., repeatedly adding to each pixel’s cost the weighted values\nof its neighboring pixels’ costs (Szeliski and Hinton 1985; Shah 1993; Scharstein and Szeliski\n1998).\nOf the local aggregation methods compared by Gong, Yang, Wang et al. (2007) and\nTombari, Mattoccia, Di Stefano et al. (2008), the fast variable window approach of Vek-\nsler (2003) and the locally weighting approach developed by Yoon and Kweon (2006) con-\nsistently stood out as having the best tradeoff between performance and speed.5 The local\nweighting technique, in particular, is interesting because, instead of using square windows\nwith uniform weighting, each pixel within an aggregation window inﬂuences the ﬁnal match-\n5 More recent and extensive results from Tombari, Mattoccia, Di Stefano et al.
