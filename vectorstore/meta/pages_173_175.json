The reason they call their resulting pyramid a Gaussian\npyramid is that repeated convolutions of the binomial kernel converge to a Gaussian.16\nTo compute the Laplacian pyramid, Burt and Adelson ﬁrst interpolate a lower resolu-\ntion image to obtain a reconstructed low-pass version of the original image (Figure 3.34b).\nThey then subtract this low-pass version from the original to yield the band-pass “Laplacian”\nimage, which can be stored away for further processing. The resulting pyramid has perfect\nreconstruction, i.e., the Laplacian images plus the base-level Gaussian (L2 in Figure 3.34b)\nare sufﬁcient to exactly reconstruct the original image. Figure 3.33 shows the same com-\nputation in one dimension as a signal processing diagram, which completely captures the\ncomputations being performed during the analysis and re-synthesis stages.\nBurt and Adelson also describe a variant on the Laplacian pyramid, where the low-pass\nimage is taken from the original blurred image rather than the reconstructed pyramid (piping\nthe output of the L box directly to the subtraction in Figure 3.34b). This variant has less\n16 Then again, this is true for any smoothing kernel (Wells 1986).\n152\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n¼\n⅜\n¼\n16\n1\n16\n1\n¼\n⅜\n¼\n16\n1\n16\n1\n½\n¾\n½\n½\n¾\n½\n⅛\n⅛\n⅛\n⅛\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 3.33 The Gaussian pyramid shown as a signal processing diagram: The (a) analysis\nand (b) re-synthesis stages are shown as using similar computations.

During reconstruction, the interpolated image and the\n(optionally ﬁltered) high-pass image are added back together. The Q box indicates quantiza-\ntion or some other pyramid processing, e.g., noise removal by coring (setting small wavelet\nvalues to 0). (b) The actual computation of the high-pass ﬁlter involves ﬁrst interpolating the\ndownsampled low-pass image and then subtracting it. This results in perfect reconstruction\nwhen Q is the identity.
