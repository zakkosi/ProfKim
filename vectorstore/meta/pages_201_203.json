For exam-\nple, (3.100) can be generalized to\nE1r\n=\nX\ni,j\nsx(i, j)ρ(f(i + 1, j) −f(i, j))\n(3.104)\n+ sy(i, j)ρ(f(i, j + 1) −f(i, j)),\nwhere ρ(x) is some monotonically increasing penalty function. For example, the family of\nnorms ρ(x) = |x|p is called p-norms. When p < 2, the resulting smoothness terms become\nmore piecewise continuous than totally smooth, which can better model the discontinuous\nnature of images, ﬂow ﬁelds, and 3D surfaces.\nAn early example of robust regularization is the graduated non-convexity (GNC) algo-\nrithm introduced by Blake and Zisserman (1987). Here, the norms on the data and derivatives\nare clamped to a maximum value\nρ(x) = min(x2, V ).\n(3.105)\nBecause the resulting problem is highly non-convex (it has many local minima), a continua-\ntion method is proposed, where a quadratic norm (which is convex) is gradually replaced by\nthe non-convex robust norm (Allgower and Georg 2003). (Around the same time, Terzopou-\nlos (1988) was also using continuation to infer the tear and crease variables in his surface\ninterpolation problems.)\nToday, it is more common to use the L1 (p = 1) norm, which is often called total variation\n(Chan, Osher, and Shen 2001; Tschumperl´e and Deriche 2005; Tschumperl´e 2006; Kaftory,\nSchechner, and Zeevi 2007). Other norms, for which the inﬂuence (derivative) more quickly\ndecays to zero, are presented by Black and Rangarajan (1996); Black, Sapiro, Marimont et\nal. (1998) and discussed in Appendix B.3.\nEven more recently, hyper-Laplacian norms with p < 1 have gained popularity, based\non the observation that the log-likelihood distribution of image derivatives follows a p ≈\n0.5 −0.8 slope and is therefore a hyper-Laplacian distribution (Simoncelli 1999; Levin and\nWeiss 2007; Weiss and Freeman 2007; Krishnan and Fergus 2009). Such norms have an even\nstronger tendency to prefer large discontinuities over small ones. See the related discussion\nin Section 3.7.2 (3.114).\nWhile least squares regularized problems using L2 norms can be solved using linear sys-\ntems, other p-norms require different iterative techniques, such as iteratively reweighted least\nsquares (IRLS), Levenberg–Marquardt, or alternation between local non-linear subproblems\nand global quadratic regularization (Krishnan and Fergus 2009). Such techniques are dis-\ncussed in Section 6.1.3 and Appendices A.3 and B.3.\n180\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n3.7.2 Markov random ﬁelds\nAs we have just seen, regularization, which involves the minimization of energy functionals\ndeﬁned over (piecewise) continuous functions, can be used to formulate and solve a variety\nof low-level computer vision problems. An alternative technique is to formulate a Bayesian\nmodel, which separately models the noisy image formation (measurement) process, as well\nas assuming a statistical prior model over the solution space. In this section, we look at\npriors based on Markov random ﬁelds, whose log-likelihood can be described using local\nneighborhood interaction (or penalty) terms (Kindermann and Snell 1980; Geman and Geman\n1984; Marroquin, Mitter, and Poggio 1987; Li 1995; Szeliski, Zabih, Scharstein et al. 2008).\nThe use of Bayesian modeling has several potential advantages over regularization (see\nalso Appendix B). The ability to model measurement processes statistically enables us to\nextract the maximum information possible from each measurement, rather than just guessing\nwhat weighting to give the data. Similarly, the parameters of the prior distribution can often\nbe learned by observing samples from the class we are modeling (Roth and Black 2007a;\nTappen 2007; Li and Huttenlocher 2008). Furthermore, because our model is probabilistic,\nit is possible to estimate (in principle) complete probability distributions over the unknowns\nbeing recovered and, in particular, to model the uncertainty in the solution, which can be\nuseful in latter processing stages. Finally, Markov random ﬁeld models can be deﬁned over\ndiscrete variables, such as image labels (where the variables have no proper ordering), for\nwhich regularization does not apply.\nRecall from (3.68) in Section 3.4.3 (or see Appendix B.4) that, according to Bayes’ Rule,\nthe posterior distribution for a given set of measurements y, p(y|x), combined with a prior\np(x) over the unknowns x, is given by\np(x|y) = p(y|x)p(x)\np(y)\n,\n(3.106)\nwhere p(y) =\nR\nx p(y|x)p(x) is a normalizing constant used to make the p(x|y) distribution\nproper (integrate to 1). Taking the negative logarithm of both sides of (3.106), we get\n−log p(x|y) = −log p(y|x) −log p(x) + C,\n(3.107)\nwhich is the negative posterior log likelihood.\nTo ﬁnd the most likely (maximum a posteriori or MAP) solution x given some measure-\nments y, we simply minimize this negative log likelihood, which can also be thought of as an\nenergy,\nE(x, y) = Ed(x, y) + Ep(x).\n(3.108)\n(We drop the constant C because its value does not matter during energy minimization.) The\nﬁrst term Ed(x, y) is the data energy or data penalty; it measures the negative log likelihood\n3.7 Global optimization\n181\nthat the data were observed given the unknown state x. The second term Ep(x) is the prior\nenergy; it plays a role analogous to the smoothness energy in regularization. Note that the\nMAP estimate may not always be desirable, since it selects the “peak” in the posterior dis-\ntribution rather than some more stable statistic—see the discussion in Appendix B.2 and by\nLevin, Weiss, Durand et al. (2009).\nFor image processing applications, the unknowns x are the set of output pixels\nx = [f(0, 0) . . . f(m −1, n −1)],\nand the data are (in the simplest case) the input pixels\ny = [d(0, 0) . . . d(m −1, n −1)]\nas shown in Figure 3.56.\nFor a Markov random ﬁeld, the probability p(x) is a Gibbs or Boltzmann distribution,\nwhose negative log likelihood (according to the Hammersley–Clifford theorem) can be writ-\nten as a sum of pairwise interaction potentials,\nEp(x) =\nX\n{(i,j),(k,l)}∈N\nVi,j,k,l(f(i, j), f(k, l)),\n(3.109)\nwhere N(i, j) denotes the neighbors of pixel (i, j). In fact, the general version of the theorem\nsays that the energy may have to be evaluated over a larger set of cliques, which depend on\nthe order of the Markov random ﬁeld (Kindermann and Snell 1980; Geman and Geman 1984;\nBishop 2006; Kohli, Ladick´y, and Torr 2009; Kohli, Kumar, and Torr 2009).\nThe most commonly used neighborhood in Markov random ﬁeld modeling is the N4\nneighborhood, where each pixel in the ﬁeld f(i, j) interacts only with its immediate neigh-\nbors. The model in Figure 3.56, which we previously used in Figure 3.55 to illustrate the\ndiscrete version of ﬁrst-order regularization, shows an N4 MRF. The sx(i, j) and sy(i, j)\nblack boxes denote arbitrary interaction potentials between adjacent nodes in the random\nﬁeld and the w(i, j) denote the data penalty functions. These square nodes can also be inter-\npreted as factors in a factor graph version of the (undirected) graphical model (Bishop 2006),\nwhich is another name for interaction potentials. (Strictly speaking, the factors are (improper)\nprobability functions whose product is the (un-normalized) posterior distribution.)\nAs we will see in (3.112–3.113), there is a close relationship between these interaction\npotentials and the discretized versions of regularized image restoration problems. Thus, to\na ﬁrst approximation, we can view energy minimization being performed when solving a\nregularized problem and the maximum a posteriori inference being performed in an MRF as\nequivalent.\nWhile N4 neighborhoods are most commonly used, in some applications N8 (or even\nhigher order) neighborhoods perform better at tasks such as image segmentation because",
