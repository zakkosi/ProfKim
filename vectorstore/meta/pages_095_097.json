Notice in this equation how the amount of\nlight depends on the pixel surface area (which is why the smaller sensors in point-and-shoot\ncameras are so much noisier than digital single lens reﬂex (SLR) cameras), the inverse square\nof the f-stop N = f/d (2.97), and the fourth power of the cos4 α off-axis fall-off, which is\nthe natural vignetting term.\nThe other major kind of vignetting, called mechanical vignetting, is caused by the internal\nocclusion of rays near the periphery of lens elements in a compound lens, and cannot easily\nbe described mathematically without performing a full ray-tracing of the actual lens design.9\nHowever, unlike natural vignetting, mechanical vignetting can be decreased by reducing the\ncamera aperture (increasing the f-number). It can also be calibrated (along with natural vi-\ngnetting) using special devices such as integrating spheres, uniformly illuminated targets, or\ncamera rotation, as discussed in Section 10.1.3.\n2.3 The digital camera\nAfter starting from one or more light sources, reﬂecting off one or more surfaces in the world,\nand passing through the camera’s optics (lenses), light ﬁnally reaches the imaging sensor.\nHow are the photons arriving at this sensor converted into the digital (R, G, B) values that\nwe observe when we look at a digital image? In this section, we develop a simple model\nthat accounts for the most important effects such as exposure (gain and shutter speed), non-\nlinear mappings, sampling and aliasing, and noise. Figure 2.23, which is based on camera\nmodels developed by Healey and Kondepudy (1994); Tsin, Ramesh, and Kanade (2001); Liu,\nSzeliski, Kang et al. (2008), shows a simple version of the processing stages that occur in\nmodern digital cameras. Chakrabarti, Scharstein, and Zickler (2009) developed a sophisti-\ncated 24-parameter model that is an even better match to the processing performed in today’s\ncameras.\n9 There are some empirical models that work well in practice (Kang and Weiss 2000; Zheng, Lin, and Kang\n2006).\n74\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nFigure 2.23 Image sensing pipeline, showing the various sources of noise as well as typical\ndigital post-processing steps.\nLight falling on an imaging sensor is usually picked up by an active sensing area, inte-\ngrated for the duration of the exposure (usually expressed as the shutter speed in a fraction of\na second, e.g.,\n1\n125,\n1\n60,\n1\n30), and then passed to a set of sense ampliﬁers . The two main kinds\nof sensor used in digital still and video cameras today are charge-coupled device (CCD) and\ncomplementary metal oxide on silicon (CMOS).\nIn a CCD, photons are accumulated in each active well during the exposure time. Then,\nin a transfer phase, the charges are transferred from well to well in a kind of “bucket brigade”\nuntil they are deposited at the sense ampliﬁers, which amplify the signal and pass it to\nan analog-to-digital converter (ADC).10 Older CCD sensors were prone to blooming, when\ncharges from one over-exposed pixel spilled into adjacent ones, but most newer CCDs have\nanti-blooming technology (“troughs” into which the excess charge can spill).\nIn CMOS, the photons hitting the sensor directly affect the conductivity (or gain) of a\nphotodetector, which can be selectively gated to control exposure duration, and locally am-\npliﬁed before being read out using a multiplexing scheme.\nTraditionally, CCD sensors\noutperformed CMOS in quality sensitive applications, such as digital SLRs, while CMOS\nwas better for low-power applications, but today CMOS is used in most digital cameras.\nThe main factors affecting the performance of a digital image sensor are the shutter speed,\nsampling pitch, ﬁll factor, chip size, analog gain, sensor noise, and the resolution (and quality)\n10 In digital still cameras, a complete frame is captured and then read out sequentially at once. However, if video\nis being captured, a rolling shutter, which exposes and transfers each line separately, is often used. In older video\ncameras, the even ﬁelds (lines) were scanned ﬁrst, followed by the odd ﬁelds, in a process that is called interlacing.\n2.3 The digital camera\n75\nof the analog-to-digital converter. Many of the actual values for these parameters can be read\nfrom the EXIF tags embedded with digital images. while others can be obtained from the\ncamera manufacturers’ speciﬁcation sheets or from camera review or calibration Web sites.11\nShutter speed.\nThe shutter speed (exposure time) directly controls the amount of light\nreaching the sensor and, hence, determines if images are under- or over-exposed. (For bright\nscenes, where a large aperture or slow shutter speed are desired to get a shallow depth of ﬁeld\nor motion blur, neutral density ﬁlters are sometimes used by photographers.) For dynamic\nscenes, the shutter speed also determines the amount of motion blur in the resulting picture.\nUsually, a higher shutter speed (less motion blur) makes subsequent analysis easier (see Sec-\ntion 10.3 for techniques to remove such blur). However, when video is being captured for\ndisplay, some motion blur may be desirable to avoid stroboscopic effects.\nSampling pitch.\nThe sampling pitch is the physical spacing between adjacent sensor cells\non the imaging chip. A sensor with a smaller sampling pitch has a higher sampling density and\nhence provides a higher resolution (in terms of pixels) for a given active chip area. However,\na smaller pitch also means that each sensor has a smaller area and cannot accumulate as many\nphotons; this makes it not as light sensitive and more prone to noise.\nFill factor.\nThe ﬁll factor is the active sensing area size as a fraction of the theoretically\navailable sensing area (the product of the horizontal and vertical sampling pitches). Higher\nﬁll factors are usually preferable, as they result in more light capture and less aliasing (see\nSection 2.3.1). However, this must be balanced with the need to place additional electronics\nbetween the active sense areas.\nThe ﬁll factor of a camera can be determined empirically\nusing a photometric camera calibration process (see Section 10.1.4).\nChip size.\nVideo and point-and-shoot cameras have traditionally used small chip areas ( 1\n4-\ninch to 1\n2-inch sensors12), while digital SLR cameras try to come closer to the traditional size\nof a 35mm ﬁlm frame.13 When overall device size is not important, having a larger chip\nsize is preferable, since each sensor cell can be more photo-sensitive. (For compact cameras,\na smaller chip means that all of the optics can be shrunk down proportionately.) However,\n11 http://www.clarkvision.com/imagedetail/digital.sensor.performance.summary/ .\n12 These numbers refer to the “tube diameter” of the old vidicon tubes used in video cameras (http://www.\ndpreview.com/learn/?/Glossary/Camera System/sensor sizes 01.htm). The 1/2.5” sensor on the Canon SD800 cam-\nera actually measures 5.76mm × 4.29mm, i.e., a sixth of the size (on side) of a 35mm full-frame (36mm × 24mm)\nDSLR sensor.\n13 When a DSLR chip does not ﬁll the 35mm full frame, it results in a multiplier effect on the lens focal length.\nFor example, a chip that is only 0.6 the dimension of a 35mm frame will make a 50mm lens image the same angular\nextent as a 50/0.6 = 50 × 1.6 =80mm lens, as demonstrated in (2.60).",
