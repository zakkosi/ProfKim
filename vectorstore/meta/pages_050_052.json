Unless otherwise noted,\nvectors operate as column vectors, i.e., they post-multiply matrices, Mv, although they are\nsometimes written as comma-separated parenthesized lists x = (x, y) instead of bracketed\ncolumn vectors x = [x y]T . Some commonly used matrices are R for rotations, K for\ncalibration matrices, and I for the identity matrix. Homogeneous coordinates (Section 2.1)\nare denoted with a tilde over the vector, e.g., ˜x = (˜x, ˜y, ˜w) = ˜w(x, y, 1) = ˜w¯x in P2. The\ncross product operator in matrix form is denoted by [ ]×.\n1.6 Additional reading\nThis book attempts to be self-contained, so that students can implement the basic assignments\nand algorithms described here without the need for outside references. However, it does pre-\nsuppose a general familiarity with basic concepts in linear algebra and numerical techniques,\nwhich are reviewed in Appendix A, and image processing, which is reviewed in Chapter 3.\nStudents who want to delve more deeply into these topics can look in (Golub and Van\nLoan 1996) for matrix algebra and (Strang 1988) for linear algebra. In image processing,\nthere are a number of popular textbooks, including (Crane 1997; Gomes and Velho 1997;\nJ¨ahne 1997; Pratt 2007; Russ 2007; Burger and Burge 2008; Gonzales and Woods 2008). For\ncomputer graphics, popular texts include (Foley, van Dam, Feiner et al. 1995; Watt 1995),\nwith (Glassner 1995) providing a more in-depth look at image formation and rendering. For\nstatistics and machine learning, Chris Bishop’s (2006) book is a wonderful and comprehen-\nsive introduction with a wealth of exercises. Students may also want to look in other textbooks\non computer vision for material that we do not cover here, as well as for additional project\nideas (Ballard and Brown 1982; Faugeras 1993; Nalwa 1993; Trucco and Verri 1998; Forsyth\nand Ponce 2003).\nThere is, however, no substitute for reading the latest research literature, both for the lat-\nest ideas and techniques and for the most up-to-date references to related literature.15 In this\nbook, I have attempted to cite the most recent work in each ﬁeld so that students can read them\ndirectly and use them as inspiration for their own work. Browsing the last few years’ con-\nference proceedings from the major vision and graphics conferences, such as CVPR, ECCV,\nICCV, and SIGGRAPH, will provide a wealth of new ideas. The tutorials offered at these\nconferences, for which slides or notes are often available on-line, are also an invaluable re-\nsource.\n15 For a comprehensive bibliography and taxonomy of computer vision research, Keith Price’s Annotated Com-\nputer Vision Bibliography http://www.visionbib.com/bibliography/contents.html is an invaluable resource.\nChapter 2\nImage formation\n2.1\nGeometric primitives and transformations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n31\n2.1.1\nGeometric primitives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n32\n2.1.2\n2D transformations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n35\n2.1.3\n3D transformations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n39\n2.1.4\n3D rotations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n41\n2.1.5\n3D to 2D projections . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n46\n2.1.6\nLens distortions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n58\n2.2\nPhotometric image formation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n60\n2.2.1\nLighting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n60\n2.2.2\nReﬂectance and shading . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n62\n2.2.3\nOptics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n68\n2.3\nThe digital camera\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n73\n2.3.1\nSampling and aliasing\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n77\n2.3.2\nColor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n80\n2.3.3\nCompression . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n90\n2.4\nAdditional reading\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n93\n2.5\nExercises\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n93\n30\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nn^\n(a)\n(b)\nzi=102mm\nf = 100mm\nzo=5m\nd\nG\nR\nG\nR\nB\nG\nB\nG\nG\nR\nG\nR\nB\nG\nB\nG\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 2.1\nA few components of the image formation process: (a) perspective projection;\n(b) light scattering when hitting a surface; (c) lens optics; (d) Bayer color ﬁlter array.",
