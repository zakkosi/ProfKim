An important component of\nthis matching is to verify whether the set of matching features is geometrically consistent,\ne.g., whether the feature displacements can be described by a simple 2D or 3D geometric\ntransformation. The computed motions can then be used in other applications such as image\nstitching (Chapter 9) or augmented reality (Section 6.2.3).\nIn this chapter, we look at the topic of geometric image registration, i.e., the computation\nof 2D and 3D transformations that map features in one image to another (Section 6.1). One\nspecial case of this problem is pose estimation, which is determining a camera’s position\nrelative to a known 3D object or scene (Section 6.2). Another case is the computation of a\ncamera’s intrinsic calibration, which consists of the internal parameters such as focal length\nand radial distortion (Section 6.3). In Chapter 7, we look at the related problems of how\nto estimate 3D point structure from 2D matches (triangulation) and how to simultaneously\nestimate 3D geometry and camera motion (structure from motion).\n6.1 2D and 3D feature-based alignment\nFeature-based alignment is the problem of estimating the motion between two or more sets\nof matched 2D or 3D points. In this section, we restrict ourselves to global parametric trans-\nformations, such as those described in Section 2.1.2 and shown in Table 2.1 and Figure 6.2,\nor higher order transformation for curved surfaces (Shashua and Toelg 1997; Can, Stewart,\nRoysam et al. 2002). Applications to non-rigid or elastic deformations (Bookstein 1989;\nSzeliski and Lavall´ee 1996; Torresani, Hertzmann, and Bregler 2008) are examined in Sec-\ntions 8.3 and 12.6.4.\n312\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nTransform\nMatrix\nParameters p\nJacobian J\ntranslation\n\"\n1\n0\ntx\n0\n1\nty\n#\n(tx, ty)\n\"\n1\n0\n0\n1\n#\nEuclidean\n\"\ncθ\n−sθ\ntx\nsθ\ncθ\nty\n#\n(tx, ty, θ)\n\"\n1\n0\n−sθx −cθy\n0\n1\ncθx −sθy\n#\nsimilarity\n\"\n1 + a\n−b\ntx\nb\n1 + a\nty\n#\n(tx, ty, a, b)\n\"\n1\n0\nx\n−y\n0\n1\ny\nx\n#\nafﬁne\n\"\n1 + a00\na01\ntx\na10\n1 + a11\nty\n#\n(tx, ty, a00, a01, a10, a11)\n\"\n1\n0\nx\ny\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\nx\ny\n#\nprojective\n\n\n1 + h00\nh01\nh02\nh10\n1 + h11\nh12\nh20\nh21\n1\n\n\n(h00, h01, . . . , h21)\n(see Section 6.1.3)\nTable 6.1 Jacobians of the 2D coordinate transformations x′ = f(x; p) shown in Table 2.1,\nwhere we have re-parameterized the motions so that they are identity for p = 0.\n6.1.1 2D alignment using least squares\nGiven a set of matched feature points {(xi, x′\ni)} and a planar parametric transformation1 of\nthe form\nx′ = f(x; p),\n(6.1)\nhow can we produce the best estimate of the motion parameters p?
