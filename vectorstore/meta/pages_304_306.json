To reduce\nthe amount of computation required, only a small strip (frontier) around the locations of the\ncurrent zero-crossing needs to updated at each step, which results in what are called fast\nmarching methods (Sethian 1999).\nAn example of an evolution equation is the geodesic active contour proposed by Caselles,\nKimmel, and Sapiro (1997) and Yezzi, Kichenassamy, Kumar et al. (1997),\ndφ\ndt\n=\n|∇φ|div\n\u0012\ng(I) ∇φ\n|∇φ|\n\u0013\n=\ng(I)|∇φ|div\n\u0012 ∇φ\n|∇φ|\n\u0013\n+ ∇g(I) · ∇φ,\n(5.19)\nwhere g(I) is a generalized version of the snake edge potential (5.5). To get an intuitive sense\nof the curve’s behavior, assume that the embedding function φ is a signed distance function\naway from the curve (Figure 5.10), in which case |φ| = 1. The ﬁrst term in Equation (5.19)\nmoves the curve in the direction of its curvature, i.e., it acts to straighten the curve, under\nthe inﬂuence of the modulation function g(I). The second term moves the curve down the\ngradient of g(I), encouraging the curve to migrate towards minima of g(I).\nWhile this level-set formulation can readily change topology, it is still susceptible to lo-\ncal minima, since it is based on local measurements such as image gradients. An alternative\napproach is to re-cast the problem in a segmentation framework, where the energy measures\nthe consistency of the image statistics (e.g., color, texture, motion) inside and outside the seg-\nmented regions (Cremers, Rousson, and Deriche 2007; Rousson and Paragios 2008; Houhou,\nThiran, and Bresson 2008). These approaches build on earlier energy-based segmentation\nframeworks introduced by Leclerc (1989), Mumford and Shah (1989), and Chan and Vese\n(1992), which are discussed in more detail in Section 5.5. Examples of such level-set seg-\nmentations are shown in Figure 5.11, which shows the evolution of the level sets from a series\nof distributed circles towards the ﬁnal binary segmentation.\nFor more information on level sets and their applications, please see the collection of\npapers edited by Osher and Paragios (2003) as well as the series of Workshops on Variational\nand Level Set Methods in Computer Vision (Paragios, Faugeras, Chan et al. 2005) and Special\nIssues on Scale Space and Variational Methods in Computer Vision (Paragios and Sgallari\n2009).\n5.1.5 Application: Contour tracking and rotoscoping\nActive contours can be used in a wide variety of object-tracking applications (Blake and Isard\n1998; Yilmaz, Javed, and Shah 2006). For example, they can be used to track facial features\n5.1 Active contours\n283\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5.11\nLevel set segmentation (Cremers, Rousson, and Deriche 2007) c⃝2007\nSpringer: (a) grayscale image segmentation and (b) color image segmentation. Uni-variate\nand multi-variate Gaussians are used to model the foreground and background pixel dis-\ntributions. The initial circles evolve towards an accurate segmentation of foreground and\nbackground, adapting their topology as they evolve.\nfor performance-driven animation (Terzopoulos and Waters 1990; Lee, Terzopoulos, and Wa-\nters 1995; Parke and Waters 1996; Bregler, Covell, and Slaney 1997) (Figure 5.2b). They can\nalso be used to track heads and people, as shown in Figure 5.8, as well as moving vehicles\n(Paragios and Deriche 2000). Additional applications include medical image segmentation,\nwhere contours can be tracked from slice to slice in computerized tomography (3D medical\nimagery) (Cootes and Taylor 2001) or over time, as in ultrasound scans.\nAn interesting application that is closer to computer animation and visual effects is ro-\ntoscoping, which uses the tracked contours to deform a set of hand-drawn animations (or\nto modify or replace the original video frames).7 Agarwala, Hertzmann, Seitz et al. (2004)\npresent a system based on tracking hand-drawn B-spline contours drawn at selected keyframes,\nusing a combination of geometric and appearance-based criteria (Figure 5.12). They also pro-\nvide an excellent review of previous rotoscoping and image-based, contour-tracking systems.\n7 The term comes from a device (a rotoscope) that projected frames of a live-action ﬁlm underneath an acetate so\nthat artists could draw animations directly over the actors’ shapes.\n284\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 5.12 Keyframe-based rotoscoping (Agarwala, Hertzmann, Seitz et al. 2004) c⃝2004\nACM: (a) original frames; (b) rotoscoped contours; (c) re-colored blouse; (d) rotoscoped\nhand-drawn animation.\nAdditional applications of rotoscoping (object contour detection and segmentation), such\nas cutting and pasting objects from one photograph into another, are presented in Section 10.4.\n5.2 Split and merge\nAs mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the simplest possible technique for seg-\nmenting a grayscale image is to select a threshold and then compute connected components\n(Section 3.3.2). Unfortunately, a single threshold is rarely sufﬁcient for the whole image\nbecause of lighting and intra-object statistical variations.\nIn this section, we describe a number of algorithms that proceed either by recursively\nsplitting the whole image into pieces based on region statistics or, conversely, merging pixels\nand regions together in a hierarchical fashion. It is also possible to combine both splitting and\nmerging by starting with a medium-grain segmentation (in a quadtree representation) and\nthen allowing both merging and splitting operations (Horowitz and Pavlidis 1976; Pavlidis\nand Liow 1990).\n5.2.1 Watershed\nA technique related to thresholding, since it operates on a grayscale image, is watershed com-\nputation (Vincent and Soille 1991). This technique segments an image into several catchment\nbasins, which are the regions of an image (interpreted as a height ﬁeld or landscape) where",
