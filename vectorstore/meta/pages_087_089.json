(b)\nMirror (specular) reﬂection: The incident light ray direction ˆvi is reﬂected onto the specular\ndirection ˆsi around the surface normal ˆn.\nwe can compute the specular reﬂection direction ˆsi as\nˆsi = v∥−v⊥= (2ˆnˆnT −I)vi.\n(2.89)\nThe amount of light reﬂected in a given direction ˆvr thus depends on the angle θs =\ncos−1(ˆvr · ˆsi) between the view direction ˆvr and the specular direction ˆsi. For example, the\nPhong (1975) model uses a power of the cosine of the angle,\nfs(θs; λ) = ks(λ) coske θs,\n(2.90)\nwhile the Torrance and Sparrow (1967) micro-facet model uses a Gaussian,\nfs(θs; λ) = ks(λ) exp(−c2\nsθ2\ns).\n(2.91)\nLarger exponents ke (or inverse Gaussian widths cs) correspond to more specular surfaces\nwith distinct highlights, while smaller exponents better model materials with softer gloss.\nPhong shading\nPhong (1975) combined the diffuse and specular components of reﬂection with another term,\nwhich he called the ambient illumination. This term accounts for the fact that objects are\ngenerally illuminated not only by point light sources but also by a general diffuse illumination\ncorresponding to inter-reﬂection (e.g., the walls in a room) or distant sources, such as the\n66\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nAmbient\nDiffuse\nExp=10\nExp=100\nExp=1000\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n-0.5\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nAmbient\nDiffuse\nExp=10\nExp=100\nExp=1000\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2.18 Cross-section through a Phong shading model BRDF for a ﬁxed incident illu-\nmination direction: (a) component values as a function of angle away from surface normal;\n(b) polar plot.

In the Phong model, the ambient term does not depend on surface orientation, but\ndepends on the color of both the ambient illumination La(λ) and the object ka(λ),\nfa(λ) = ka(λ)La(λ).\n(2.92)\nPutting all of these terms together, we arrive at the Phong shading model,\nLr(ˆvr; λ) = ka(λ)La(λ) + kd(λ)\nX\ni\nLi(λ)[ˆvi · ˆn]+ + ks(λ)\nX\ni\nLi(λ)(ˆvr · ˆsi)ke. (2.93)\nFigure 2.18 shows a typical set of Phong shading model components as a function of the\nangle away from the surface normal (in a plane containing both the lighting direction and the\nviewer).\nTypically, the ambient and diffuse reﬂection color distributions ka(λ) and kd(λ) are the\nsame, since they are both due to sub-surface scattering (body reﬂection) inside the surface\nmaterial (Shafer 1985). The specular reﬂection distribution ks(λ) is often uniform (white),\nsince it is caused by interface reﬂections that do not change the light color. (The exception\nto this are metallic materials, such as copper, as opposed to the more common dielectric\nmaterials, such as plastics.)\nThe ambient illumination La(λ) often has a different color cast from the direct light\nsources Li(λ), e.g., it may be blue for a sunny outdoor scene or yellow for an interior lit\nwith candles or incandescent lights. (The presence of ambient sky illumination in shadowed\nareas is what often causes shadows to appear bluer than the corresponding lit portions of a\nscene). Note also that the diffuse component of the Phong model (or of any shading model)\ndepends on the angle of the incoming light source ˆvi, while the specular component depends\non the relative angle between the viewer vr and the specular reﬂection direction ˆsi (which\nitself depends on the incoming light direction ˆvi and the surface normal ˆn).\n2.2 Photometric image formation\n67\nThe Phong shading model has been superseded in terms of physical accuracy by a number\nof more recently developed models in computer graphics, including the model developed by\nCook and Torrance (1982) based on the original micro-facet model of Torrance and Sparrow\n(1967). Until recently, most computer graphics hardware implemented the Phong model but\nthe recent advent of programmable pixel shaders makes the use of more complex models\nfeasible.\nDi-chromatic reﬂection model\nThe Torrance and Sparrow (1967) model of reﬂection also forms the basis of Shafer’s (1985)\ndi-chromatic reﬂection model, which states that the apparent color of a uniform material lit\nfrom a single source depends on the sum of two terms,\nLr(ˆvr; λ)\n=\nLi(ˆvr, ˆvi, ˆn; λ) + Lb(ˆvr, ˆvi, ˆn; λ)\n(2.94)\n=\nci(λ)mi(ˆvr, ˆvi, ˆn) + cb(λ)mb(ˆvr, ˆvi, ˆn),\n(2.95)\ni.e., the radiance of the light reﬂected at the interface, Li, and the radiance reﬂected at the sur-\nface body, Lb. Each of these, in turn, is a simple product between a relative power spectrum\nc(λ), which depends only on wavelength, and a magnitude m(ˆvr, ˆvi, ˆn), which depends only\non geometry. (This model can easily be derived from a generalized version of Phong’s model\nby assuming a single light source and no ambient illumination, and re-arranging terms.) The\ndi-chromatic model has been successfully used in computer vision to segment specular col-\nored objects with large variations in shading (Klinker 1993) and more recently has inspired\nlocal two-color models for applications such Bayer pattern demosaicing (Bennett, Uytten-\ndaele, Zitnick et al. 2006).\nGlobal illumination (ray tracing and radiosity)\nThe simple shading model presented thus far assumes that light rays leave the light sources,\nbounce off surfaces visible to the camera, thereby changing in intensity or color, and arrive\nat the camera. In reality, light sources can be shadowed by occluders and rays can bounce\nmultiple times around a scene while making their trip from a light source to the camera.\nTwo methods have traditionally been used to model such effects. If the scene is mostly\nspecular (the classic example being scenes made of glass objects and mirrored or highly pol-\nished balls), the preferred approach is ray tracing or path tracing (Glassner 1995; Akenine-\nM¨oller and Haines 2002; Shirley 2005), which follows individual rays from the camera across\nmultiple bounces towards the light sources (or vice versa). If the scene is composed mostly\nof uniform albedo simple geometry illuminators and surfaces, radiosity (global illumination)\ntechniques are preferred (Cohen and Wallace 1993; Sillion and Puech 1994; Glassner 1995).",
