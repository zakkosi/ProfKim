While computers excel at\naccurately reconstructing the 3D shape of a scene from images taken from different views,\nthey cannot name all the objects and animals present in a picture, even at the level of a two-\nyear-old child. There is not even any consensus among researchers on when this level of\nperformance might be achieved.\nWhy is recognition so hard? The real world is made of a jumble of objects, which all oc-\nclude one another and appear in different poses. Furthermore, the variability intrinsic within\na class (e.g., dogs), due to complex non-rigid articulation and extreme variations in shape and\nappearance (e.g., between different breeds), makes it unlikely that we can simply perform\nexhaustive matching against a database of exemplars.1\nThe recognition problem can be broken down along several axes. For example, if we\nknow what we are looking for, the problem is one of object detection (Section 14.1), which\ninvolves quickly scanning an image to determine where a match may occur (Figure 14.1c). If\nwe have a speciﬁc rigid object we are trying to recognize (instance recognition, Section 14.3),\nwe can search for characteristic feature points (Section 4.1) and verify that they align in a\ngeometrically plausible way (Section 14.3.1) (Figure 14.1d).\nThe most challenging version of recognition is general category (or class) recognition\n(Section 14.4), which may involve recognizing instances of extremely varied classes such\nas animals or furniture. Some techniques rely purely on the presence of features (known\nas a “bag of words” model—see Section 14.4.1), their relative positions (part-based models\n(Section 14.4.2)), Figure 14.1e, while others involve segmenting the image into semantically\nmeaningful regions (Section 14.4.3) (Figure 14.1f). In many instances, recognition depends\nheavily on the context of surrounding objects and scene elements (Section 14.5). Woven into\nall of these techniques is the topic of learning (Section 14.5.1), since hand-crafting speciﬁc\nobject recognizers seems like a futile approach given the complexity of the problem.\nGiven the extremely rich and complex nature of this topic, this chapter is structured to\nbuild from simpler concepts to more complex ones. We begin with a discussion of face and\nobject detection (Section 14.1), where we introduce a number of machine-learning techniques\nsuch as boosting, neural networks, and support vector machines. Next, we study face recogni-\ntion (Section 14.2), which is one of the more widely known applications of recognition. This\ntopic serves as an introduction to subspace (PCA) models and Bayesian approaches to recog-\nnition and classiﬁcation. We then present techniques for instance recognition (Section 14.3),\nbuilding upon earlier topics in this book, such as feature detection, matching, and geomet-\nric alignment (Section 14.3.1). We introduce topics from the information and document re-\ntrieval communities, such as frequency vectors, feature quantization, and inverted indices\n1 However, some recent research suggests that direct image matching may be feasible for large enough databases\n(Russell, Torralba, Liu et al. 2007; Malisiewicz and Efros 2008; Torralba, Freeman, and Fergus 2008).",
