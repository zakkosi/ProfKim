The resulting set of linear equations can\nbe solved using least squares, and the quality of the solution (residual error) can be used to\ncheck for erroneous correspondences.\nThe resulting set of 3D points, along with their spatial (in-image) and temporal (between-\nimage) neighbors, form a 3D surface mesh with local normal and curvature estimates (Fig-\nures 11.7c and g). Note that whenever a curve is due to a surface marking or a sharp crease\nedge, rather than a smooth surface proﬁle curve, this shows up as a 0 or small radius of curva-\nture. Such curves result in isolated 3D space curves, rather than elements of smooth surface\nmeshes, but can still be incorporated into the 3D surface model during a later stage of surface\ninterpolation (Section 12.3.1).\n11.3 Dense correspondence\nWhile sparse matching algorithms are still occasionally used, most stereo matching algo-\nrithms today focus on dense correspondence, since this is required for applications such as\nimage-based rendering or modeling. This problem is more challenging than sparse corre-\nspondence, since inferring depth values in textureless regions requires a certain amount of\nguesswork. (Think of a solid colored background seen through a picket fence. What depth\nshould it be?)\nIn this section, we review the taxonomy and categorization scheme for dense correspon-\ndence algorithms ﬁrst proposed by Scharstein and Szeliski (2002). The taxonomy consists\nof a set of algorithmic “building blocks” from which a large set of algorithms can be con-\nstructed. It is based on the observation that stereo algorithms generally perform some subset\nof the following four steps:\n1. matching cost computation;\n2. cost (support) aggregation;\n3. disparity computation and optimization; and\n4. disparity reﬁnement.\n546\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nFor example, local (window-based) algorithms (Section 11.4), where the disparity com-\nputation at a given point depends only on intensity values within a ﬁnite window, usually\nmake implicit smoothness assumptions by aggregating support. Some of these algorithms\ncan cleanly be broken down into steps 1, 2, 3. For example, the traditional sum-of-squared-\ndifferences (SSD) algorithm can be described as:\n1. The matching cost is the squared difference of intensity values at a given disparity.\n2. Aggregation is done by summing the matching cost over square windows with constant\ndisparity.\n3. Disparities are computed by selecting the minimal (winning) aggregated value at each\npixel.\nSome local algorithms, however, combine steps 1 and 2 and use a matching cost that is based\non a support region, e.g. normalized cross-correlation (Hannah 1974; Bolles, Baker, and Han-\nnah 1993) and the rank transform (Zabih and Woodﬁll 1994) and other ordinal measures (Bhat\nand Nayar 1998). (This can also be viewed as a preprocessing step; see (Section 11.3.1).)\nGlobal algorithms, on the other hand, make explicit smoothness assumptions and then\nsolve a a global optimization problem (Section 11.5). Such algorithms typically do not per-\nform an aggregation step, but rather seek a disparity assignment (step 3) that minimizes a\nglobal cost function that consists of data (step 1) terms and smoothness terms. The main dis-\ntinctions among these algorithms is the minimization procedure used, e.g., simulated anneal-\ning (Marroquin, Mitter, and Poggio 1987; Barnard 1989), probabilistic (mean-ﬁeld) diffusion\n(Scharstein and Szeliski 1998), expectation maximization (EM) (Birchﬁeld, Natarajan, and\nTomasi 2007), graph cuts (Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih 2001), or loopy belief propagation\n(Sun, Zheng, and Shum 2003), to name just a few.\nIn between these two broad classes are certain iterative algorithms that do not explicitly\nspecify a global function to be minimized, but whose behavior mimics closely that of iterative\noptimization algorithms (Marr and Poggio 1976; Zitnick and Kanade 2000). Hierarchical\n(coarse-to-ﬁne) algorithms resemble such iterative algorithms, but typically operate on an\nimage pyramid where results from coarser levels are used to constrain a more local search at\nﬁner levels (Witkin, Terzopoulos, and Kass 1987; Quam 1984; Bergen, Anandan, Hanna et\nal. 1992).\n11.3.1 Similarity measures\nThe ﬁrst component of any dense stereo matching algorithm is a similarity measure that\ncompares pixel values in order to determine how likely they are to be in correspondence. In\nthis section, we brieﬂy review the similarity measures introduced in Section 8.1 and mention a\n11.3 Dense correspondence\n547\nfew others that have been developed speciﬁcally for stereo matching (Scharstein and Szeliski\n2002; Hirschm¨uller and Scharstein 2009).\nThe most common pixel-based matching costs include sums of squared intensity differ-\nences (SSD) (Hannah 1974) and absolute intensity differences (SAD) (Kanade 1994). In\nthe video processing community, these matching criteria are referred to as the mean-squared\nerror (MSE) and mean absolute difference (MAD) measures; the term displaced frame dif-\nference is also often used (Tekalp 1995).\nMore recently, robust measures (8.2), including truncated quadratics and contaminated\nGaussians, have been proposed (Black and Anandan 1996; Black and Rangarajan 1996;\nScharstein and Szeliski 1998). These measures are useful because they limit the inﬂuence\nof mismatches during aggregation. Vaish, Szeliski, Zitnick et al. (2006) compare a number\nof such robust measures, including a new one based on the entropy of the pixel values at a\nparticular disparity hypothesis (Zitnick, Kang, Uyttendaele et al. 2004), which is particularly\nuseful in multi-view stereo.\nOther traditional matching costs include normalized cross-correlation (8.11) (Hannah\n1974; Bolles, Baker, and Hannah 1993; Evangelidis and Psarakis 2008), which behaves\nsimilarly to sum-of-squared-differences (SSD), and binary matching costs (i.e., match or no\nmatch) (Marr and Poggio 1976), based on binary features such as edges (Baker and Binford\n1981; Grimson 1985) or the sign of the Laplacian (Nishihara 1984). Because of their poor\ndiscriminability, simple binary matching costs are no longer used in dense stereo matching.\nSome costs are insensitive to differences in camera gain or bias, for example gradient-\nbased measures (Seitz 1989; Scharstein 1994), phase and ﬁlter-bank responses (Marr and\nPoggio 1979; Kass 1988; Jenkin, Jepson, and Tsotsos 1991; Jones and Malik 1992), ﬁlters\nthat remove regular or robust (bilaterally ﬁltered) means (Ansar, Castano, and Matthies 2004;\nHirschm¨uller and Scharstein 2009), dense feature descriptor (Tola, Lepetit, and Fua 2010),\nand non-parametric measures such as rank and census transforms (Zabih and Woodﬁll 1994),\nordinal measures (Bhat and Nayar 1998), or entropy (Zitnick, Kang, Uyttendaele et al. 2004;\nZitnick and Kang 2007). The census transform, which converts each pixel inside a moving\nwindow into a bit vector representing which neighbors are above or below the central pixel,\nwas found by Hirschm¨uller and Scharstein (2009) to be quite robust against large-scale, non-\nstationary exposure and illumination changes.\nIt is also possible to correct for differing global camera characteristics by performing\na preprocessing or iterative reﬁnement step that estimates inter-image bias–gain variations\nusing global regression (Gennert 1988), histogram equalization (Cox, Roy, and Hingorani\n1995), or mutual information (Kim, Kolmogorov, and Zabih 2003; Hirschm¨uller 2008). Lo-\ncal, smoothly varying compensation ﬁelds have also been proposed (Strecha, Tuytelaars, and\nVan Gool 2003; Zhang, McMillan, and Yu 2006).\nIn order to compensate for sampling issues, i.e., dramatically different pixel values in",
