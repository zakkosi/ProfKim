In multi-view stereo, algo-\nrithms have a choice of computing these measures directly on the surface of the model, i.e., in\nscene space, or projecting pixel values from one image (or from a textured model) back into\nanother image, i.e., in image space. (The latter corresponds more closely to a Bayesian ap-\nproach, since input images are noisy measurements of the colored 3D model.) The geometry\nof the object, i.e., its distance to each camera and its local surface normal, when available, can\nbe used to adjust the matching windows used in the computation to account for foreshortening\nand scale change (Goesele, Snavely, Curless et al. 2007).\nVisibility model.\nA big advantage that multi-view stereo algorithms have over single-depth-\nmap approaches is their ability to reason in a principled manner about visibility and occlu-\nsions. Techniques that use the current state of the 3D model to predict which surface pixels\nare visible in each image (Kutulakos and Seitz 2000; Faugeras and Keriven 1998; Vogiatzis,\nHernandez, Torr et al. 2007; Hiep, Keriven, Pons et al. 2009) are classiﬁed as using geometric\nvisibility models in the taxonomy of Seitz, Curless, Diebel et al. (2006). Techniques that se-\nlect a neighboring subset of image to match are called quasi-geometric (Narayanan, Rander,\nand Kanade 1998; Kang and Szeliski 2004; Hernandez and Schmitt 2004), while techniques\nthat use traditional robust similarity measures are called outlier-based. While full geometric\nreasoning is the most principled and accurate approach, it can be very slow to evaluate and\ndepends on the evolving quality of the current surface estimate to predict visibility, which can\nbe a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem, unless conservative assumptions are used, as they are\nby Kutulakos and Seitz (2000).\nShape priors.\nBecause stereo matching is often underconstrained, especially in texture-\nless regions, most matching algorithms adopt (either explicitly or implicitly) some form of\nprior model for the expected shape. Many of the techniques that rely on optimization use a\n3D smoothness or area-based photoconsistency constraint, which, because of the natural ten-\ndency of smooth surfaces to shrink inwards, often results in a minimal surface prior (Faugeras\nand Keriven 1998; Sinha and Pollefeys 2005; Vogiatzis, Hernandez, Torr et al. 2007). Ap-\nproaches that carve away the volume of space often stop once a photoconsistent solution is\nfound (Seitz and Dyer 1999; Kutulakos and Seitz 2000), which corresponds to a maximal sur-\nface bias, i.e., these techniques tend to over-estimate the true shape. Finally, multiple depth\nmap approaches often adopt traditional image-based smoothness (regularization) constraints.\nReconstruction algorithm.\nThe details of how the actual reconstruction algorithm pro-\nceeds is where the largest variety—and greatest innovation—in multi-view stereo algorithms\n566\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\ncan be found.\nSome approaches use global optimization deﬁned over a three-dimensional photoconsis-\ntency volume to recover a complete surface. Approaches based on graph cuts use polynomial\ncomplexity binary segmentation algorithms to recover the object model deﬁned on the voxel\ngrid (Sinha and Pollefeys 2005; Vogiatzis, Hernandez, Torr et al. 2007; Hiep, Keriven, Pons\net al. 2009). Level set approaches use a continuous surface evolution to ﬁnd a good mini-\nmum in the conﬁguration space of potential surfaces and therefore require a reasonably good\ninitialization (Faugeras and Keriven 1998; Pons, Keriven, and Faugeras 2007). In order for\nthe photoconsistency volume to be meaningful, matching costs need to be computed in some\nrobust fashion, e.g., using sets of limited views or by aggregating multiple depth maps.\nAn alternative approach to global optimization is to sweep through the 3D volume while\ncomputing both photoconsistency and visibility simultaneously. The voxel coloring algorithm\nof Seitz and Dyer (1999) performs a front-to-back plane sweep. On every plane, any voxels\nthat are sufﬁciently photoconsistent are labeled as part of the object. The corresponding\npixels in the source images can then be “erased”, since they are already accounted for, and\ntherefore do not contribute to further photoconsistency computations. (A similar approach,\nalbeit without the front-to-back sweep order, is used by Szeliski and Golland (1999).) The\nresulting 3D volume, under noise- and resampling-free conditions, is guaranteed to produce\nboth a photoconsistent 3D model and to enclose whatever true 3D object model generated the\nimages.\nUnfortunately, voxel coloring is only guaranteed to work if all of the cameras lie on the\nsame side of the sweep planes, which is not possible in general ring conﬁgurations of cameras.\nKutulakos and Seitz (2000) generalize voxel coloring to space carving, where subsets of\ncameras that satisfy the voxel coloring constraint are iteratively selected and the 3D voxel\ngrid is alternately carved away along different axes.\nAnother popular approach to multi-view stereo is to ﬁrst independently compute multiple\ndepth maps and then merge these partial maps into a complete 3D model. Approaches to\ndepth map merging, which are discussed in more detail in Section 12.2.1, include signed\ndistance functions (Curless and Levoy 1996), used by Goesele, Curless, and Seitz (2006),\nand Poisson surface reconstruction (Kazhdan, Bolitho, and Hoppe 2006), used by Goesele,\nSnavely, Curless et al. (2007). It is also possible to reconstruct sparser representations, such\nas 3D points and lines, and to interpolate them to full 3D surfaces (Section 12.3.1) (Taylor\n2003).\nInitialization requirements.\nOne ﬁnal element discussed by Seitz, Curless, Diebel et al.\n(2006) is the varying degrees of initialization required by different algorithms. Because some\nalgorithms reﬁne or evolve a rough 3D model, they require a reasonably accurate (or over-\ncomplete) initial model, which can often be obtained by reconstructing a volume from object\n11.6 Multi-view stereo\n567\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\nFigure 11.20 The multi-view stereo data sets captured by Seitz, Curless, Diebel et al.

However, if the algorithm performs a global op-\ntimization (Kolev, Klodt, Brox et al. 2009; Kolev and Cremers 2009), this dependence on\ninitialization is not an issue.\nEmpirical evaluation.\nIn order to evaluate the large number of design alternatives in multi-\nview stereo, Seitz, Curless, Diebel et al. (2006) collected a dataset of calibrated images using\na spherical gantry. A representative image from each of the six datasets is shown in Fig-\nure 11.20, although only the ﬁrst two datasets have as yet been fully processed and used for\nevaluation. Figure 11.21 shows the results of running seven different algorithms on the tem-\nple dataset. As you can see, most of the techniques do an impressive job of capturing the ﬁne\ndetails in the columns, although it is also clear that the techniques employ differing amounts\nof smoothing to achieve these results.\nSince the publication of the survey by Seitz, Curless, Diebel et al. (2006), the ﬁeld of\nmulti-view stereo has continued to advance at a rapid pace (Strecha, Fransens, and Van\nGool 2006; Hernandez, Vogiatzis, and Cipolla 2007; Habbecke and Kobbelt 2007; Furukawa\nand Ponce 2007; Vogiatzis, Hernandez, Torr et al. 2007; Goesele, Snavely, Curless et al.\n2007; Sinha, Mordohai, and Pollefeys 2007; Gargallo, Prados, and Sturm 2007; Merrell, Ak-\nbarzadeh, Wang et al. 2007; Zach, Pock, and Bischof 2007b; Furukawa and Ponce 2008;\nHornung, Zeng, and Kobbelt 2008; Bradley, Boubekeur, and Heidrich 2008; Zach 2008;\nCampbell, Vogiatzis, Hern´andez et al. 2008; Kolev, Klodt, Brox et al. 2009; Hiep, Keriven,\nPons et al. 2009; Furukawa, Curless, Seitz et al. 2010).
