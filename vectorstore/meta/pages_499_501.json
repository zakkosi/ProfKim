A portion of an actual sensed image is shown in the middle and a close-up of the ideal\npattern is on the right.\nﬁt the central portion of the input image and its intensities are adjusted to ﬁt the ones in\nthe sensed image. If desired, the pattern can be rendered at a higher resolution than the input\nimage, which enables the estimation of the PSF to sub-pixel resolution (Figure 10.8a). Finally\na large linear least squares system is solved to recover the unknown PSF kernel K,\nK = arg min\nK ∥B −D(I ∗K)∥2,\n(10.1)\nwhere B is the sensed (blurred) image, I is the predicted (sharp) image, and D is an optional\ndownsampling operator that matches the resolution of the ideal and sensed images (Joshi,\nSzeliski, and Kriegman 2008). In terms of the notation (3.75) introduced in Section 3.4.3,\nthis could also be written as\nb = arg min\nb\n∥o −D(s ∗b)∥2,\n(10.2)\nwhere o is the observed image, s is the sharp image, and b is the blur kernel.\nIf the process of estimating the PSF is done locally in overlapping patches of the image,\nit can also be used to estimate the radial distortion and chromatic aberration induced by the\nlens (Figure 10.8b). Because the homography mapping the ideal target to the sensed image\nis estimated in the central (undistorted) part of the image, any (per-channel) shifts induced\nby the optics manifest themselves as a displacement in the PSF centers.10 Compensating\nfor these shifts eliminates both the achromatic radial distortion and the inter-channel shifts\nthat result in visible chromatic aberration. The color-dependent blurring caused by chromatic\naberration (Figure 2.21) can also be removed using the de-blurring techniques discussed in\n10 This process confounds the distinction between geometric and photometric calibration. In principle, any ge-\nometric distortion could be modeled by spatially varying displaced PSFs. In practice, it is easier to fold any large\nshifts into the geometric correction component.\n478\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n−2\n−1\n0 \n1 \n2 \n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n−2\n−1\n0 \n1 \n2 \n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n−2\n−1\n0 \n1 \n2 \n−2\n−1\n0\n1\n2\n−2\n−1\n0 \n1 \n2 \n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 10.8 Point spread function estimation using a calibration target (Joshi, Szeliski, and\nKriegman 2008) c⃝2008 IEEE.

(b) The radial\ndistortion and chromatic aberration can also be estimated and removed. (c) PSF for a mis-\nfocused (blurred) lens showing some diffraction and vignetting effects in the corners.\nSection 10.3. Figure 10.8b shows how the radial distortion and chromatic aberration manifest\nthemselves as elongated and displaced PSFs, along with the result of removing these effects\nin a region of the calibration target.\nThe local 2D PSF estimation technique can also be used to estimate vignetting. Fig-\nure 10.8c shows how the mechanical vignetting manifests itself as clipping of the PSF in the\ncorners of the image. In order for the overall dimming associated with vignetting to be prop-\nerly captured, the modiﬁed intensities of the ideal pattern need to be extrapolated from the\ncenter, which is best done with a uniformly illuminated target.\nWhen working with RAW Bayer-pattern images, the correct way to estimate the PSF is\nto only evaluate the least squares terms in (10.1) at sensed pixel values, while interpolating\nthe ideal image to all values. For JPEG images, you should linearize your intensities ﬁrst,\ne.g., remove the gamma and any other non-linearities in your estimated radiometric response\nfunction.\nWhat if you have an image that was taken with an uncalibrated camera? Can you still\nrecover the PSF an use it to correct the image? In fact, with a slight modiﬁcation, the previous\nalgorithms still work.\nInstead of assuming a known calibration image, you can detect strong elongated edges\nand ﬁt ideal step edges in such regions (Figure 10.9b), resulting in the sharp image shown\n10.2 High dynamic range imaging\n479\nMin\nMax\nR\nR\nValid  Region\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 10.9\nEstimating the PSF without using a calibration pattern (Joshi, Szeliski, and\nKriegman 2008) c⃝2008 IEEE: (a) Input image with blue cross-section (proﬁle) location, (b)\nProﬁle of sensed and predicted step edges, (c–d) Locations and values of the predicted colors\nnear the edge locations.\nin Figure 10.9d. For every pixel that is surrounded by a complete set of valid estimated\nneighbors (green pixels in Figure 10.9c), apply the least squares formula (10.1) to estimate\nthe kernel K. The resulting locally estimated PSFs can be used to correct for chromatic\naberration (since the relative displacements between per-channel PSFs can be computed), as\nshown by Joshi, Szeliski, and Kriegman (2008).\nExercise 10.4 provides some more detailed instructions for implementing and testing\nedge-based PSF estimation algorithms. An alternative approach, which does not require the\nexplicit detection of edges but uses image statistics (gradient distributions) instead, is pre-\nsented by Fergus, Singh, Hertzmann et al. (2006).\n10.2 High dynamic range imaging\nAs we mentioned earlier in this chapter, registered images taken at different exposures can be\nused to calibrate the radiometric response function of a camera.
