The\napproach of Bennett, Uyttendaele, Zitnick et al. (2006) locally forms a two-color model from\nan initial demosaicing result, using a moving 5 × 5 window to ﬁnd the two dominant colors\n(Figure 10.36).21\nOnce the local color model has been estimated at each pixel, a Bayesian approach is\nthen used to encourage pixel values to lie along each color line and to cluster around the\ndominant color values, which reduces halos (Figure 10.35d). The Bayesian approach also\nsupports the simultaneous application of demosaicing and super-resolution, i.e., multiple CFA\ninputs can be merged into a higher-quality full-color image, which becomes more important\nas additional processing becomes incorporated into today’s cameras.\n10.3.2 Application: Colorization\nAlthough not strictly an example of super-resolution, the process of colorization, i.e., manu-\nally adding colors to a “black and white” (grayscale) image, is another example of a sparse\ninterpolation problem. In most applications of colorization, the user draws some scribbles in-\ndicating the desired colors in certain regions (Figure 10.37a) and the system interpolates the\n21 Previous work on locally linear color models (Klinker, Shafer, and Kanade 1990; Omer and Werman 2004)\nfocuses on color and illumination variation within a single material, whereas Bennett, Uyttendaele, Zitnick et al.\n(2006) use the two-color model to describe variations across color (material) edges.\n10.4 Image matting and compositing\n505\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 10.37 Colorization using optimization (Levin, Lischinski, and Weiss 2004) c⃝2004\nACM: (a) grayscale image some color scribbles overlaid; (b) resulting colorized image; (c)\noriginal color image from which the grayscale image and the chrominance values for the\nscribbles were derived.

In the\nsystem developed by Levin, Lischinski, and Weiss (2004), the interpolation is performed us-\ning locally weighted regularization (3.100), where the local smoothness weights are inversely\nproportional to luminance gradients. This approach to locally weighted regularization has\ninspired later algorithms for high dynamic range tone mapping (Lischinski, Farbman, Uyt-\ntendaele et al. 2006a), see Section 10.2.1, as well as other applications of the weighted least\nsquares (WLS) formulation (Farbman, Fattal, Lischinski et al. 2008). An alternative approach\nto performing the sparse chrominance interpolation based on geodesic (edge-aware) distance\nfunctions has been developed by Yatziv and Sapiro (2006).\n10.4 Image matting and compositing\nImage matting and compositing is the process of cutting a foreground object out of one image\nand pasting it against a new background (Smith and Blinn 1996; Wang and Cohen 2007a).\nIt is commonly used in television and ﬁlm production to composite a live actor in front of\ncomputer-generated imagery such as weather maps or 3D virtual characters and scenery\n(Wright 2006; Brinkmann 2008).\nWe have already seen a number of tools for interactively segmenting objects in an image,\nincluding snakes (Section 5.1.1), scissors (Section 5.1.3), and GrabCut segmentation (Sec-\ntion 5.5). While these techniques can generate reasonable pixel-accurate segmentations, they\nfail to capture the subtle interplay of foreground and background colors at mixed pixels along\nthe boundary (Szeliski and Golland 1999) (Figure 10.38a).\nIn order to successfully copy a foreground object from one image to another without",
