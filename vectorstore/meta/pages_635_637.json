(a) Appearance models (BRDFs) are re-estimated\nusing divisive clustering. (b) In order to model detailed spatially varying appearance, each\nlumitexel is projected onto the basis formed by the clustered materials.\nWeyrich, Lawrence, Lensch et al. (2008) provide a nice survey of these and related topics,\nincluding basic photometry, BRDF models, traditional BRDF acquisition using gonio reﬂec-\ntometry (the precise measurement of visual angles and reﬂectances), multiplexed illumination\n(Schechner, Nayar, and Belhumeur 2009), skin modeling (Debevec, Hawkins, Tchou et al.\n2000; Weyrich, Matusik, Pﬁster et al. 2006), and image-based acquisition techniques, which\nsimultaneously recover an object’s 3D shape and reﬂectometry from multiple photographs.\nA nice example of this latter approach is the system developed by Lensch, Kautz, Goesele\net al. (2003), who estimate locally varying BRDFs and reﬁne their shape models using local\nestimates of surface normals. To build up their models, they ﬁrst associate a lumitexels, which\ncontains a 3D position, a surface normal, and a set of sparse radiance samples, with each\nsurface point. Next, they cluster such lumitexels into materials that share common properties,\nusing a Lafortune reﬂectance model (Lafortune, Foo, Torrance et al. 1997) and a divisive\nclustering approach (Figure 12.23a). Finally, in order to model detailed spatially varying\nappearance, each lumitexel (surface point) is projected onto the basis of clustered appearance\nmodels (Figure 12.23b).\nWhile most of the techniques discussed in this section require large numbers of views\nto estimate surface properties, a challenging future direction will be to take these techniques\nout of the lab and into the real world, and to combine them with regular and Internet photo\nimage-based modeling approaches.\n12.7.2 Application: 3D photography\nThe techniques described in this chapter for building complete 3D models from multiple im-\nages and then recovering their surface appearance have opened up a whole new range of\napplications that often go under the name 3D photography. Pollefeys and Van Gool (2002)\nprovide a nice introduction to this ﬁeld, including the processing steps of feature matching,\n614\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nstructure from motion recovery,15 dense depth map estimation, 3D model building, and tex-\nture map recovery. A complete Web-based system for automatically performing all of these\ntasks, called ARC3D, is described by Vergauwen and Van Gool (2006) and Moons, Van Gool,\nand Vergauwen (2010). The latter paper provides not only an in-depth survey of this whole\nﬁeld but also a detailed description of their complete end-to-end system.\nAn alternative to such fully automated systems is to put the user in the loop in what is\nsometimes called interactive computer vision. van den Hengel, Dick, Thormhlen et al. (2007)\ndescribe their VideoTrace system, which performs automated point tracking and 3D structure\nrecovery from video and then lets the user draw triangles and surfaces on top of the resulting\npoint cloud, as well as interactively adjusting the locations of model vertices. Sinha, Steedly,\nSzeliski et al. (2008) describe a related system that uses matched vanishing points in multiple\nimages (Figure 4.45) to infer 3D line orientations and plane normals. These are then used to\nguide the user drawing axis-aligned planes, which are automatically ﬁtted to the recovered\n3D point cloud. Fully automated variants on these ideas are described by Zebedin, Bauer,\nKarner et al. (2008), Furukawa, Curless, Seitz et al. (2009a), Furukawa, Curless, Seitz et al.\n(2009b), Miˇcuˇs´ık and Koˇseck´a (2009), and Sinha, Steedly, and Szeliski (2009).\nAs the sophistication and reliability of these techniques continues to improve, we can ex-\npect to see even more user-friendly applications for photorealistic 3D modeling from images\n(Exercise 12.8).\n12.8 Additional reading\nShape from shading is one of the classic problems in computer vision (Horn 1975). Some\nrepresentative papers in this area include those by Horn (1977), Ikeuchi and Horn (1981),\nPentland (1984), Horn and Brooks (1986), Horn (1990), Szeliski (1991a), Mancini and Wolff\n(1992), Dupuis and Oliensis (1994), and Fua and Leclerc (1995). The collection of papers\nedited by Horn and Brooks (1989) is a great source of information on this topic, especially\nthe chapter on variational approaches. The survey by Zhang, Tsai, Cryer et al. (1999) not\nonly reviews more recent techniques but also provides some comparative results.\nWoodham (1981) wrote the seminal paper of photometric stereo. Shape from texture\ntechniques include those by Witkin (1981), Ikeuchi (1981), Blostein and Ahuja (1987), Gard-\ning (1992), Malik and Rosenholtz (1997), Liu, Collins, and Tsin (2004), Liu, Lin, and Hays\n(2004), Hays, Leordeanu, Efros et al. (2006), Lin, Hays, Wu et al. (2006), Lobay and Forsyth\n(2006), White and Forsyth (2006), White, Crane, and Forsyth (2007), and Park, Brockle-\nhurst, Collins et al. (2009). Good papers and books on depth from defocus have been written\nby Pentland (1987), Nayar and Nakagawa (1994), Nayar, Watanabe, and Noguchi (1996),\n15 These earlier steps are also discussed in Section 7.4.4.\n12.8 Additional reading\n615\nWatanabe and Nayar (1998), Chaudhuri and Rajagopalan (1999), and Favaro and Soatto\n(2006). Additional techniques for recovering shape from various kinds of illumination ef-\nfects, including inter-reﬂections (Nayar, Ikeuchi, and Kanade 1991), are discussed in the\nbook on shape recovery edited by Wolff, Shafer, and Healey (1992b).\nActive rangeﬁnding systems, which use laser or natural light illumination projected into\nthe scene, have been described by Besl (1989), Rioux and Bird (1993), Kang, Webb, Zit-\nnick et al. (1995), Curless and Levoy (1995), Curless and Levoy (1996), Proesmans, Van\nGool, and Defoort (1998), Bouguet and Perona (1999), Curless (1999), Hebert (2000), Id-\ndan and Yahav (2001), Goesele, Fuchs, and Seidel (2003), Scharstein and Szeliski (2003),\nDavis, Ramamoorthi, and Rusinkiewicz (2003), Zhang, Curless, and Seitz (2003), Zhang,\nSnavely, Curless et al. (2004), and Moons, Van Gool, and Vergauwen (2010). Individual\nrange scans can be aligned using 3D correspondence and distance optimization techniques\nsuch as iterated closest points and its variants (Besl and McKay 1992; Zhang 1994; Szeliski\nand Lavall´ee 1996; Johnson and Kang 1997; Gold, Rangarajan, Lu et al. 1998; Johnson\nand Hebert 1999; Pulli 1999; David, DeMenthon, Duraiswami et al. 2004; Li and Hartley\n2007; Enqvist, Josephson, and Kahl 2009). Once they have been aligned, range scans can\nbe merged using techniques that model the signed distance of surfaces to volumetric sam-\nple points (Hoppe, DeRose, Duchamp et al. 1992; Curless and Levoy 1996; Hilton, Stoddart,\nIllingworth et al. 1996; Wheeler, Sato, and Ikeuchi 1998; Kazhdan, Bolitho, and Hoppe 2006;\nLempitsky and Boykov 2007; Zach, Pock, and Bischof 2007b; Zach 2008).\nOnce constructed, 3D surfaces can be modeled and manipulated using a variety of three-\ndimensional representations, which include triangle meshes (Eck, DeRose, Duchamp et al.\n1995; Hoppe 1996), splines (Farin 1992, 1996; Lee, Wolberg, and Shin 1996), subdivision\nsurfaces (Stollnitz, DeRose, and Salesin 1996; Zorin, Schr¨oder, and Sweldens 1996; Warren\nand Weimer 2001; Peters and Reif 2008), and geometry images (Gu, Gortler, and Hoppe\n2002). Alternatively, they can be represented as collections of point samples with local ori-\nentation estimates (Hoppe, DeRose, Duchamp et al. 1992; Szeliski and Tonnesen 1992; Turk\nand O’Brien 2002; Pﬁster, Zwicker, van Baar et al. 2000; Alexa, Behr, Cohen-Or et al. 2003;\nPauly, Keiser, Kobbelt et al. 2003; Diebel, Thrun, and Br¨unig 2006; Guennebaud and Gross\n2007; Guennebaud, Germann, and Gross 2008; Oztireli, Guennebaud, and Gross 2008). They\ncan also be modeled using implicit inside–outside characteristic or signed distance functions\nsampled on regular or irregular (octree) volumetric grids (Lavall´ee and Szeliski 1995; Szeliski\nand Lavall´ee 1996; Frisken, Perry, Rockwood et al. 2000; Dinh, Turk, and Slabaugh 2002;\nKazhdan, Bolitho, and Hoppe 2006; Lempitsky and Boykov 2007; Zach, Pock, and Bischof\n2007b; Zach 2008).\nThe literature on model-based 3D reconstruction is extensive. For modeling architecture\nand urban scenes, both interactive and fully automated systems have been developed.
