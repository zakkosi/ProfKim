The original transform pair is\nF(ω) = F{f(x)}.\n• Superposition: The Fourier transform of a sum of signals is the sum of their Fourier\ntransforms. Thus, the Fourier transform is a linear operator.\n• Shift: The Fourier transform of a shifted signal is the transform of the original signal\nmultiplied by a linear phase shift (complex sinusoid).\n• Reversal: The Fourier transform of a reversed signal is the complex conjugate of the\nsignal’s transform.\n• Convolution: The Fourier transform of a pair of convolved signals is the product of\ntheir transforms.\n• Correlation: The Fourier transform of a correlation is the product of the ﬁrst transform\ntimes the complex conjugate of the second one.\n• Multiplication: The Fourier transform of the product of two signals is the convolution\nof their transforms.\n• Differentiation: The Fourier transform of the derivative of a signal is that signal’s\ntransform multiplied by the frequency. In other words, differentiation linearly empha-\nsizes (magniﬁes) higher frequencies.\n• Domain scaling: The Fourier transform of a stretched signal is the equivalently com-\npressed (and scaled) version of the original transform and vice versa.\n136\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n• Real images: The Fourier transform of a real-valued signal is symmetric around the\norigin. This fact can be used to save space and to double the speed of image FFTs\nby packing alternating scanlines into the real and imaginary parts of the signal being\ntransformed.\n• Parseval’s Theorem: The energy (sum of squared values) of a signal is the same as\nthe energy of its Fourier transform.\nAll of these properties are relatively straightforward to prove (see Exercise 3.15) and they will\ncome in handy later in the book, e.g., when designing optimum Wiener ﬁlters (Section 3.4.3)\nor performing fast image correlations (Section 8.1.2).\n3.4.1 Fourier transform pairs\nNow that we have these properties in place, let us look at the Fourier transform pairs of some\ncommonly occurring ﬁlters and signals, as listed in Table 3.2. In more detail, these pairs are\nas follows:\n• Impulse: The impulse response has a constant (all frequency) transform.\n• Shifted impulse: The shifted impulse has unit magnitude and linear phase.\n• Box ﬁlter: The box (moving average) ﬁlter\nbox(x) =\n(\n1\nif |x| ≤1\n0\nelse\n(3.55)\nhas a sinc Fourier transform,\nsinc(ω) = sin ω\nω\n,\n(3.56)\nwhich has an inﬁnite number of side lobes. Conversely, the sinc ﬁlter is an ideal low-\npass ﬁlter. For a non-unit box, the width of the box a and the spacing of the zero\ncrossings in the sinc 1/a are inversely proportional.\n• Tent: The piecewise linear tent function,\ntent(x) = max(0, 1 −|x|),\n(3.57)\nhas a sinc2 Fourier transform.\n• Gaussian: The (unit area) Gaussian of width σ,\nG(x; σ) =\n1\n√\n2πσ e−x2\n2σ2 ,\n(3.58)\nhas a (unit height) Gaussian of width σ−1 as its Fourier transform.\n3.4 Fourier transforms\n137\nName\nSignal\nTransform\nimpulse\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\nδ(x)\n⇔\n1\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\nshifted\nimpulse\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\nδ(x −u)\n⇔\ne−jωu\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\nbox ﬁlter\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\nbox(x/a)\n⇔\nasinc(aω)\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\ntent\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\ntent(x/a)\n⇔\nasinc2(aω)\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\nGaussian\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\nG(x; σ)\n⇔\n√\n2π\nσ G(ω; σ−1)\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\nLaplacian\nof Gaussian\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\n( x2\nσ4 −\n1\nσ2 )G(x; σ)\n⇔\n−\n√\n2π\nσ ω2G(ω; σ−1)\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\nGabor\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\ncos(ω0x)G(x; σ)\n⇔\n√\n2π\nσ G(ω ± ω0; σ−1)\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\nunsharp\nmask\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\n(1 + γ)δ(x)\n−γG(x; σ)\n⇔\n(1 + γ)−\n√\n2πγ\nσ\nG(ω; σ−1)\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\nwindowed\nsinc\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-1.0000\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\n1.0000\nrcos(x/(aW))\nsinc(x/a)\n⇔\n(see Figure 3.29)\n-0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n-0.5000\n0.0000\n0.5000\nTable 3.2 Some useful (continuous) Fourier transform pairs: The dashed line in the Fourier\ntransform of the shifted impulse indicates its (linear) phase. All other transforms have zero\nphase (they are real-valued). Note that the ﬁgures are not necessarily drawn to scale but\nare drawn to illustrate the general shape and characteristics of the ﬁlter or its response. In\nparticular, the Laplacian of Gaussian is drawn inverted because it resembles more a “Mexican\nhat”, as it is sometimes called.",
