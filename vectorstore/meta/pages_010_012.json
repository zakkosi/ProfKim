  "text": "x\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nAt Microsoft Research, I’ve had the outstanding fortune to work with some of the world’s\nbest researchers in computer vision and computer graphics, including Michael Cohen, Hugues\nHoppe, Stephen Gortler, Steve Shafer, Matthew Turk, Harry Shum, Anandan, Phil Torr, An-\ntonio Criminisi, Georg Petschnigg, Kentaro Toyama, Ramin Zabih, Shai Avidan, Sing Bing\nKang, Matt Uyttendaele, Patrice Simard, Larry Zitnick, Richard Hartley, Simon Winder,\nDrew Steedly, Chris Pal, Nebojsa Jojic, Patrick Baudisch, Dani Lischinski, Matthew Brown,\nSimon Baker, Michael Goesele, Eric Stollnitz, David Nist´er, Blaise Aguera y Arcas, Sudipta\nSinha, Johannes Kopf, Neel Joshi, and Krishnan Ramnath. I was also lucky to have as in-\nterns such great students as Polina Golland, Simon Baker, Mei Han, Arno Sch¨odl, Ron Dror,\nAshley Eden, Jinxiang Chai, Rahul Swaminathan, Yanghai Tsin, Sam Hasinoff, Anat Levin,\nMatthew Brown, Eric Bennett, Vaibhav Vaish, Jan-Michael Frahm, James Diebel, Ce Liu,\nJosef Sivic, Grant Schindler, Colin Zheng, Neel Joshi, Sudipta Sinha, Zeev Farbman, Rahul\nGarg, Tim Cho, Yekeun Jeong, Richard Roberts, Varsha Hedau, and Dilip Krishnan.\nWhile working at Microsoft, I’ve also had the opportunity to collaborate with wonderful\ncolleagues at the University of Washington, where I hold an Afﬁliate Professor appointment.\nI’m indebted to Tony DeRose and David Salesin, who ﬁrst encouraged me to get involved\nwith the research going on at UW, my long-time collaborators Brian Curless, Steve Seitz,\nManeesh Agrawala, Sameer Agarwal, and Yasu Furukawa, as well as the students I have\nhad the privilege to supervise and interact with, including Fr´ederic Pighin, Yung-Yu Chuang,\nDoug Zongker, Colin Zheng, Aseem Agarwala, Dan Goldman, Noah Snavely, Rahul Garg,\nand Ryan Kaminsky. As I mentioned at the beginning of this preface, this book owes its\ninception to the vision course that Steve Seitz invited me to co-teach, as well as to Steve’s\nencouragement, course notes, and editorial input.\nI’m also grateful to the many other computer vision researchers who have given me so\nmany constructive suggestions about the book, including Sing Bing Kang, who was my infor-\nmal book editor, Vladimir Kolmogorov, who contributed Appendix B.5.5 on linear program-\nming techniques for MRF inference, Daniel Scharstein, Richard Hartley, Simon Baker, Noah\nSnavely, Bill Freeman, Svetlana Lazebnik, Matthew Turk, Jitendra Malik, Alyosha Efros,\nMichael Black, Brian Curless, Sameer Agarwal, Li Zhang, Deva Ramanan, Olga Veksler,\nYuri Boykov, Carsten Rother, Phil Torr, Bill Triggs, Bruce Maxwell, Jana Koˇseck´a, Eero Si-\nmoncelli, Aaron Hertzmann, Antonio Torralba, Tomaso Poggio, Theo Pavlidis, Baba Vemuri,\nNando de Freitas, Chuck Dyer, Song Yi, Falk Schubert, Roman Pﬂugfelder, Marshall Tap-\npen, James Coughlan, Sammy Rogmans, Klaus Strobel, Shanmuganathan, Andreas Siebert,\nYongjun Wu, Fred Pighin, Juan Cockburn, Ronald Mallet, Tim Soper, Georgios Evangelidis,\nDwight Fowler, Itzik Bayaz, Daniel O’Connor, and Srikrishna Bhat. Shena Deuchers did a\nfantastic job copy-editing the book and suggesting many useful improvements and Wayne\nWheeler and Simon Rees at Springer were most helpful throughout the whole book pub-\nlishing process. Keith Price’s Annotated Computer Vision Bibliography was invaluable in\nPreface\nxi\ntracking down references and ﬁnding related work.\nIf you have any suggestions for improving the book, please send me an e-mail, as I would\nlike to keep the book as accurate, informative, and timely as possible.\nLastly, this book would not have been possible or worthwhile without the incredible sup-\nport and encouragement of my family. I dedicate this book to my parents, Zdzisław and\nJadwiga, whose love, generosity, and accomplishments have always inspired me; to my sis-\nter Basia for her lifelong friendship; and especially to Lyn, Anne, and Stephen, whose daily\nencouragement in all matters (including this book project) makes it all worthwhile.\nLake Wenatchee\nAugust, 2010\nxii\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)",
