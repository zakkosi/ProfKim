How does this process work and how can we analyze and manipulate color\nvalues?\nYou probably recall from your childhood days the magical process of mixing paint colors\nto obtain new ones. You may recall that blue+yellow makes green, red+blue makes purple,\nand red+green makes brown. If you revisited this topic at a later age, you may have learned\nthat the proper subtractive primaries are actually cyan (a light blue-green), magenta (pink),\nand yellow (Figure 2.27b), although black is also often used in four-color printing (CMYK).\n(If you ever subsequently took any painting classes, you learned that colors can have even\n2.3 The digital camera\n81\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2.27 Primary and secondary colors: (a) additive colors red, green, and blue can be\nmixed to produce cyan, magenta, yellow, and white; (b) subtractive colors cyan, magenta,\nand yellow can be mixed to produce red, green, blue, and black.\nmore fanciful names, such as alizarin crimson, cerulean blue, and chartreuse.) The subtractive\ncolors are called subtractive because pigments in the paint absorb certain wavelengths in the\ncolor spectrum.\nLater on, you may have learned about the additive primary colors (red, green, and blue)\nand how they can be added (with a slide projector or on a computer monitor) to produce cyan,\nmagenta, yellow, white, and all the other colors we typically see on our TV sets and monitors\n(Figure 2.27a).\nThrough what process is it possible for two different colors, such as red and green, to\ninteract to produce a third color like yellow? Are the wavelengths somehow mixed up to\nproduce a new wavelength?\nYou probably know that the correct answer has nothing to do with physically mixing\nwavelengths. Instead, the existence of three primaries is a result of the tri-stimulus (or tri-\nchromatic) nature of the human visual system, since we have three different kinds of cone,\neach of which responds selectively to a different portion of the color spectrum (Glassner 1995;\nWyszecki and Stiles 2000; Fairchild 2005; Reinhard, Ward, Pattanaik et al. 2005; Livingstone\n2008).18 Note that for machine vision applications, such as remote sensing and terrain clas-\nsiﬁcation, it is preferable to use many more wavelengths. Similarly, surveillance applications\ncan often beneﬁt from sensing in the near-infrared (NIR) range.\nCIE RGB and XYZ\nTo test and quantify the tri-chromatic theory of perception, we can attempt to reproduce all\nmonochromatic (single wavelength) colors as a mixture of three suitably chosen primaries.\n18 See also Mark Fairchild’s Web page, http://www.cis.rit.edu/fairchild/WhyIsColor/books links.html.\n82\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n360\n400\n440\n480\n520\n560\n600\n640\n680\n720\n760\nr\ng\nb\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\n360\n400\n440\n480\n520\n560\n600\n640\n680\n720\n760\nx\ny\nz\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2.28\nStandard CIE color matching functions: (a) ¯r(λ), ¯g(λ), ¯b(λ) color spectra\nobtained from matching pure colors to the R=700.0nm, G=546.1nm, and B=435.8nm pri-\nmaries; (b) ¯x(λ), ¯y(λ), ¯z(λ) color matching functions, which are linear combinations of the\n(¯r(λ), ¯g(λ),¯b(λ)) spectra.\n(Pure wavelength light can be obtained using either a prism or specially manufactured color\nﬁlters.) In the 1930s, the Commission Internationale d’Eclairage (CIE) standardized the RGB\nrepresentation by performing such color matching experiments using the primary colors of\nred (700.0nm wavelength), green (546.1nm), and blue (435.8nm).\nFigure 2.28 shows the results of performing these experiments with a standard observer,\ni.e., averaging perceptual results over a large number of subjects. You will notice that for\ncertain pure spectra in the blue–green range, a negative amount of red light has to be added,\ni.e., a certain amount of red has to be added to the color being matched in order to get a color\nmatch. These results also provided a simple explanation for the existence of metamers, which\nare colors with different spectra that are perceptually indistinguishable. Note that two fabrics\nor paint colors that are metamers under one light may no longer be so under different lighting.\nBecause of the problem associated with mixing negative light, the CIE also developed a\nnew color space called XYZ, which contains all of the pure spectral colors within its positive\noctant. (It also maps the Y axis to the luminance, i.e., perceived relative brightness, and maps\npure white to a diagonal (equal-valued) vector.)
