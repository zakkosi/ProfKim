Figure 10.6 shows an example of\nsimultaneously estimating the vignetting, exposure, and radiometric response function from\na set of overlapping photographs (Goldman 2011). Note that unless vignetting is modeled\nand compensated, regular gradient-domain image blending (Section 9.3.4) will not create an\nattractive image.\nIf only a single image is available, vignetting can be estimated by looking for slow con-\nsistent intensity variations in the radial direction. The original algorithm proposed by Zheng,\nLin, and Kang (2006) ﬁrst pre-segmented the image into smoothly varying regions and then\nperformed an analysis inside each region. Instead of pre-segmenting the image, Zheng, Yu,\nKang et al. (2008) compute the radial gradients at all the pixels and use the asymmetry in\nthis distribution (since gradients away from the center are, on average, slightly negative) to\n476\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nestimate the vignetting. Figure 10.5 shows the results of applying each of these algorithms\nto an image with a large amount of vignetting. Exercise 10.3 has you implement some of the\nabove techniques.\n10.1.4 Optical blur (spatial response) estimation\nOne ﬁnal characteristic of imaging systems that you should calibrate is the spatial response\nfunction, which encodes the optical blur that gets convolved with the incoming image to pro-\nduce the point-sampled image. The shape of the convolution kernel, which is also known as\npoint spread function (PSF) or optical transfer function, depends on several factors, including\nlens blur and radial distortion (Section 2.2.3), anti-aliasing ﬁlters in front of the sensor, and\nthe shape and extent of each active pixel area (Section 2.3) (Figure 10.2). A good estimate of\nthis function is required for applications such as multi-image super-resolution and de-blurring\n(Section 10.3).\nIn theory, one could estimate the PSF by simply observing an inﬁnitely small point light\nsource everywhere in the image. Creating an array of samples by drilling through a dark plate\nand backlighting with a very bright light source is difﬁcult in practice.\nA more practical approach is to observe an image composed of long straight lines or\nbars, since these can be ﬁtted to arbitrary precision. Because the location of a horizontal\nor vertical edge can be aliased during acquisition, slightly slanted edges are preferred. The\nproﬁle and locations of such edges can be estimated to sub-pixel precision, which makes it\npossible to estimate the PSF at sub-pixel resolutions (Reichenbach, Park, and Narayanswamy\n1991; Burns and Williams 1999; Williams and Burns 2001; Goesele, Fuchs, and Seidel 2003).\nThe thesis by Murphy (2005) contains a nice survey of all aspects of camera calibration,\nincluding the spatial frequency response (SFR), spatial uniformity, tone reproduction, color\nreproduction, noise, dynamic range, color channel registration, and depth of ﬁeld. It also\nincludes a description of a slant-edge calibration algorithm called sfrmat2.\nThe slant-edge technique can be used to recover a 1D projection of the 2D PSF, e.g.,\nslightly vertical edges are used to recover the horizontal line spread function (LSF) (Williams\n1999). The LSF is then often converted into the Fourier domain and its magnitude plotted as a\none-dimensional modulation transfer function (MTF), which indicates which image frequen-\ncies are lost (blurred) and aliased during the acquisition process (Section 2.3.1). For most\ncomputational photography applications, it is preferable to directly estimate the full 2D PSF,\nsince it can be hard to recover from its projections (Williams 1999).\nFigure 10.7 shows a pattern containing edges at all orientations, which can be used to\ndirectly recover a two-dimensional PSF. First, corners in the pattern are located by extracting\nedges in the sensed image, linking them, and ﬁnding the intersections of the circular arcs.\nNext, the ideal pattern, whose analytic form is known, is warped (using a homography) to\n10.1 Photometric calibration\n477\nFigure 10.7 Calibration pattern with edges equally distributed at all orientations that can be\nused for PSF and radial distortion estimation (Joshi, Szeliski, and Kriegman 2008) c⃝2008\nIEEE. A portion of an actual sensed image is shown in the middle and a close-up of the ideal\npattern is on the right.\nﬁt the central portion of the input image and its intensities are adjusted to ﬁt the ones in\nthe sensed image. If desired, the pattern can be rendered at a higher resolution than the input\nimage, which enables the estimation of the PSF to sub-pixel resolution (Figure 10.8a). Finally\na large linear least squares system is solved to recover the unknown PSF kernel K,\nK = arg min\nK ∥B −D(I ∗K)∥2,\n(10.1)\nwhere B is the sensed (blurred) image, I is the predicted (sharp) image, and D is an optional\ndownsampling operator that matches the resolution of the ideal and sensed images (Joshi,\nSzeliski, and Kriegman 2008). In terms of the notation (3.75) introduced in Section 3.4.3,\nthis could also be written as\nb = arg min\nb\n∥o −D(s ∗b)∥2,\n(10.2)\nwhere o is the observed image, s is the sharp image, and b is the blur kernel.\nIf the process of estimating the PSF is done locally in overlapping patches of the image,\nit can also be used to estimate the radial distortion and chromatic aberration induced by the\nlens (Figure 10.8b). Because the homography mapping the ideal target to the sensed image\nis estimated in the central (undistorted) part of the image, any (per-channel) shifts induced\nby the optics manifest themselves as a displacement in the PSF centers.10 Compensating\nfor these shifts eliminates both the achromatic radial distortion and the inter-channel shifts\nthat result in visible chromatic aberration. The color-dependent blurring caused by chromatic\naberration (Figure 2.21) can also be removed using the de-blurring techniques discussed in\n10 This process confounds the distinction between geometric and photometric calibration. In principle, any ge-\nometric distortion could be modeled by spatially varying displaced PSFs. In practice, it is easier to fold any large\nshifts into the geometric correction component.",
