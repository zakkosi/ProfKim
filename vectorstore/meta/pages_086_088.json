(Photo courtesy of the Caltech Vision Lab, http://www.\nvision.caltech.edu/archive.html.)\nWhile light is scattered uniformly in all directions, i.e., the BRDF is constant,\nfd(ˆvi, ˆvr, ˆn; λ) = fd(λ),\n(2.86)\nthe amount of light depends on the angle between the incident light direction and the surface\nnormal θi. This is because the surface area exposed to a given amount of light becomes larger\nat oblique angles, becoming completely self-shadowed as the outgoing surface normal points\naway from the light (Figure 2.17a). (Think about how you orient yourself towards the sun or\nﬁreplace to get maximum warmth and how a ﬂashlight projected obliquely against a wall is\nless bright than one pointing directly at it.) The shading equation for diffuse reﬂection can\nthus be written as\nLd(ˆvr; λ) =\nX\ni\nLi(λ)fd(λ) cos+ θi =\nX\ni\nLi(λ)fd(λ)[ˆvi · ˆn]+,\n(2.87)\nwhere\n[ˆvi · ˆn]+ = max(0, ˆvi · ˆn).\n(2.88)\nSpecular reﬂection\nThe second major component of a typical BRDF is specular (gloss or highlight) reﬂection,\nwhich depends strongly on the direction of the outgoing light. Consider light reﬂecting off a\nmirrored surface (Figure 2.17b). Incident light rays are reﬂected in a direction that is rotated\nby 180◦around the surface normal ˆn. Using the same notation as in Equations (2.29–2.30),\n2.2 Photometric image formation\n65\nvi•n = 1\n^  ^\n0 < vi•n < 1\n^  ^\nvi•n < 0\n^  ^\nvi•n = 0\n^  ^\nvi\nv┴\nn^\nv║\n-v┴\nsi\n180°\nv║\n^\n^\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2.17 (a) The diminution of returned light caused by foreshortening depends on ˆvi·ˆn,\nthe cosine of the angle between the incident light direction ˆvi and the surface normal ˆn. (b)\nMirror (specular) reﬂection: The incident light ray direction ˆvi is reﬂected onto the specular\ndirection ˆsi around the surface normal ˆn.\nwe can compute the specular reﬂection direction ˆsi as\nˆsi = v∥−v⊥= (2ˆnˆnT −I)vi.\n(2.89)\nThe amount of light reﬂected in a given direction ˆvr thus depends on the angle θs =\ncos−1(ˆvr · ˆsi) between the view direction ˆvr and the specular direction ˆsi. For example, the\nPhong (1975) model uses a power of the cosine of the angle,\nfs(θs; λ) = ks(λ) coske θs,\n(2.90)\nwhile the Torrance and Sparrow (1967) micro-facet model uses a Gaussian,\nfs(θs; λ) = ks(λ) exp(−c2\nsθ2\ns).\n(2.91)\nLarger exponents ke (or inverse Gaussian widths cs) correspond to more specular surfaces\nwith distinct highlights, while smaller exponents better model materials with softer gloss.\nPhong shading\nPhong (1975) combined the diffuse and specular components of reﬂection with another term,\nwhich he called the ambient illumination. This term accounts for the fact that objects are\ngenerally illuminated not only by point light sources but also by a general diffuse illumination\ncorresponding to inter-reﬂection (e.g., the walls in a room) or distant sources, such as the\n66\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nAmbient\nDiffuse\nExp=10\nExp=100\nExp=1000\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n-0.5\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nAmbient\nDiffuse\nExp=10\nExp=100\nExp=1000\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 2.18 Cross-section through a Phong shading model BRDF for a ﬁxed incident illu-\nmination direction: (a) component values as a function of angle away from surface normal;\n(b) polar plot. The value of the Phong exponent ke is indicated by the “Exp” labels and the\nlight source is at an angle of 30◦away from the normal.\nblue sky. In the Phong model, the ambient term does not depend on surface orientation, but\ndepends on the color of both the ambient illumination La(λ) and the object ka(λ),\nfa(λ) = ka(λ)La(λ).\n(2.92)\nPutting all of these terms together, we arrive at the Phong shading model,\nLr(ˆvr; λ) = ka(λ)La(λ) + kd(λ)\nX\ni\nLi(λ)[ˆvi · ˆn]+ + ks(λ)\nX\ni\nLi(λ)(ˆvr · ˆsi)ke. (2.93)\nFigure 2.18 shows a typical set of Phong shading model components as a function of the\nangle away from the surface normal (in a plane containing both the lighting direction and the\nviewer).\nTypically, the ambient and diffuse reﬂection color distributions ka(λ) and kd(λ) are the\nsame, since they are both due to sub-surface scattering (body reﬂection) inside the surface\nmaterial (Shafer 1985). The specular reﬂection distribution ks(λ) is often uniform (white),\nsince it is caused by interface reﬂections that do not change the light color. (The exception\nto this are metallic materials, such as copper, as opposed to the more common dielectric\nmaterials, such as plastics.)\nThe ambient illumination La(λ) often has a different color cast from the direct light\nsources Li(λ), e.g., it may be blue for a sunny outdoor scene or yellow for an interior lit\nwith candles or incandescent lights. (The presence of ambient sky illumination in shadowed\nareas is what often causes shadows to appear bluer than the corresponding lit portions of a\nscene). Note also that the diffuse component of the Phong model (or of any shading model)\ndepends on the angle of the incoming light source ˆvi, while the specular component depends\non the relative angle between the viewer vr and the specular reﬂection direction ˆsi (which\nitself depends on the incoming light direction ˆvi and the surface normal ˆn).",
