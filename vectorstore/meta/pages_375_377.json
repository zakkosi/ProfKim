  "text": "7.2 Two-frame structure from motion\n353\ncamera). Then, compute the FOE and check whether the residual error is small (indicating\nagreement with this rotation hypothesis) and whether the motions towards or away from the\nepipole (FOE) are all in the same direction (ignoring very small motions, which may be\nnoise-contaminated).\nPure rotation\nThe case of pure rotation results in a degenerate estimate of the essential matrix E and of\nthe translation direction ˆt.\nConsider ﬁrst the case of the rotation matrix being known. The\nestimates for the FOE will be degenerate, since xi0 ≈xi1, and hence (7.27), is degenerate.\nA similar argument shows that the equations for the essential matrix (7.13) are also rank-\ndeﬁcient.\nThis suggests that it might be prudent before computing a full essential matrix to ﬁrst\ncompute a rotation estimate R using (6.32), potentially with just a small number of points,\nand then compute the residuals after rotating the points before proceeding with a full E\ncomputation.\n7.2.1 Projective (uncalibrated) reconstruction\nIn many cases, such as when trying to build a 3D model from Internet or legacy photos taken\nby unknown cameras without any EXIF tags, we do not know ahead of time the intrinsic\ncalibration parameters associated with the input images. In such situations, we can still esti-\nmate a two-frame reconstruction, although the true metric structure may not be available, e.g.,\northogonal lines or planes in the world may not end up being reconstructed as orthogonal.\nConsider the derivations we used to estimate the essential matrix E (7.10–7.12). In the\nuncalibrated case, we do not know the calibration matrices Kj, so we cannot use the normal-\nized ray directions ˆxj = K−1\nj xj. Instead, we have access only to the image coordinates xj,\nand so the essential matrix (7.10) becomes\nˆxT\n1 Eˆx1 = xT\n1 K−T\n1\nEK−1\n0 x0 = xT\n1 F x0 = 0,\n(7.28)\nwhere\nF = K−T\n1\nEK−1\n0\n= [e]× ˜\nH\n(7.29)\nis called the fundamental matrix (Faugeras 1992; Hartley, Gupta, and Chang 1992; Hartley\nand Zisserman 2004).\nLike the essential matrix, the fundamental matrix is (in principle) rank two,\nF = [e]× ˜\nH = UΣV T =\nh\nu0\nu1\ne1\ni\n\n\nσ0\nσ1\n0\n\n\n\n\nvT\n0\nvT\n1\neT\n0\n\n.\n(7.30)\n354\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)\nIts smallest left singular vector indicates the epipole e1 in the image 1 and its smallest right\nsingular vector is e0 (Figure 7.3). The homography ˜\nH in (7.29), which in principle should\nequal\n˜\nH = K−T\n1\nRK−1\n0 ,\n(7.31)\ncannot be uniquely recovered from F , since any homography of the form ˜\nH\n′ = ˜\nH + evT\nresults in the same F matrix. (Note that [e]× annihilates any multiple of e.)\nAny one of these valid homographies ˜\nH maps some plane in the scene from one image\nto the other. It is not possible to tell in advance which one it is without either selecting four\nor more co-planar correspondences to compute ˜\nH as part of the F estimation process (in a\nmanner analogous to guessing a rotation for E) or mapping all points in one image through\n˜\nH and seeing which ones line up with their corresponding locations in the other.7\nIn order to create a projective reconstruction of the scene, we can pick any valid homog-\nraphy ˜\nH that satisﬁes Equation (7.29). For example, following a technique analogous to\nEquations (7.18–7.24), we get\nF = [e]× ˜\nH = SZR90◦ST ˜\nH = UΣV T\n(7.32)\nand hence\n˜\nH = URT\n90◦ˆΣV T ,\n(7.33)\nwhere ˆΣ is the singular value matrix with the smallest value replaced by a reasonable alter-\nnative (say, the middle value).8 We can then form a pair of camera matrices\nP 0 = [I|0]\nand\nP 0 = [ ˜\nH|e],\n(7.34)\nfrom which a projective reconstruction of the scene can be computed using triangulation\n(Section 7.1).\nWhile the projective reconstruction may not be useful in practice, it can often be upgraded\nto an afﬁne or metric reconstruction, as detailed below. Even without this step, however,\nthe fundamental matrix F can be very useful in ﬁnding additional correspondences, as they\nmust all lie on corresponding epipolar lines, i.e., any feature x0 in image 0 must have its\ncorrespondence lying on the associated epipolar line l1 = F x0 in image 1, assuming that the\npoint motions are due to a rigid transformation.\n7 This process is sometimes referred to as plane plus parallax (Section 2.1.5) (Kumar, Anandan, and Hanna 1994;\nSawhney 1994).\n8 Hartley and Zisserman (2004, p. 237) recommend using ˜\nH = [e]×F (Luong and Vi´eville 1996), which places\nthe camera on the plane at inﬁnity.\n7.2 Two-frame structure from motion\n355\n7.2.2 Self-calibration\nThe results of structure from motion computation are much more useful (and intelligible) if\na metric reconstruction is obtained, i.e., one in which parallel lines are parallel, orthogonal\nwalls are at right angles, and the reconstructed model is a scaled version of reality. Over\nthe years, a large number of self-calibration (or auto-calibration) techniques have been de-\nveloped for converting a projective reconstruction into a metric one, which is equivalent to\nrecovering the unknown calibration matrices Kj associated with each image (Hartley and\nZisserman 2004; Moons, Van Gool, and Vergauwen 2010).\nIn situations where certain additional information is known about the scene, different\nmethods may be employed. For example, if there are parallel lines in the scene (usually,\nhaving several lines converge on the same vanishing point is good evidence), three or more\nvanishing points, which are the images of points at inﬁnity, can be used to establish the ho-\nmography for the plane at inﬁnity, from which focal lengths and rotations can be recovered.\nIf two or more ﬁnite orthogonal vanishing points have been observed, the single-image cali-\nbration method based on vanishing points (Section 6.3.2) can be used instead.\nIn the absence of such external information, it is not possible to recover a fully parameter-\nized independent calibration matrix Kj for each image from correspondences alone. To see\nthis, consider the set of all camera matrices P j = Kj[Rj|tj] projecting world coordinates\npi = (Xi, Yi, Zi, Wi) into screen coordinates xij ∼P jpi. Now consider transforming the\n3D scene {pi} through an arbitrary 4 × 4 projective transformation ˜\nH, yielding a new model\nconsisting of points p′\ni = ˜\nHpi. Post-multiplying each P j matrix by ˜\nH\n−1 still produces the\nsame screen coordinates and a new set calibration matrices can be computed by applying RQ\ndecomposition to the new camera matrix P ′\nj = P j ˜\nH\n−1.\nFor this reason, all self-calibration methods assume some restricted form of the calibration\nmatrix, either by setting or equating some of their elements or by assuming that they do not\nvary over time. While most of the techniques discussed by Hartley and Zisserman (2004);\nMoons, Van Gool, and Vergauwen (2010) require three or more frames, in this section we\npresent a simple technique that can recover the focal lengths (f0, f1) of both images from the\nfundamental matrix F in a two-frame reconstruction (Hartley and Zisserman 2004, p. 456).\nTo accomplish this, we assume that the camera has zero skew, a known aspect ratio (usu-\nally set to 1), and a known optical center, as in Equation (2.59). How reasonable is this\nassumption in practice? The answer, as with many questions, is “it depends”.\nIf absolute metric accuracy is required, as in photogrammetry applications, it is imperative\nto pre-calibrate the cameras using one of the techniques from Section 6.3 and to use ground\ncontrol points to pin down the reconstruction. If instead, we simply wish to reconstruct the\nworld for visualization or image-based rendering applications, as in the Photo Tourism system\nof Snavely, Seitz, and Szeliski (2006), this assumption is quite reasonable in practice.",
