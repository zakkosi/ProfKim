As an option, consider not quantizing the features and using pyramid matching (14.40–\n14.41) (Grauman and Darrell 2007b) or using a spatial pyramid for greater selectivity\n(Lazebnik, Schmid, and Ponce 2006).\n4. Choose a classiﬁcation algorithm (e.g., nearest neighbor classiﬁcation or support vector\nmachine) and “train” your recognizer, i.e., build up the appropriate data structures (e.g.,\nk-d trees) or set the appropriate classiﬁer parameters.\n5. Test your algorithm on the test data set using the same pipeline you developed in steps\n2–4 and compare your results to the best reported results.\n6. Explain why your results differ from the previously reported ones and give some ideas\nfor how you could improve your system.\nYou can ﬁnd a good synopsis of the best-performing classiﬁcation algorithms and their ap-\nproaches in the report of the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge found on their Web\nsite (http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/).\nEx 14.11: Object detection and localization\nExtend the classiﬁcation algorithm developed\nin the previous exercise to localize the objects in an image by reporting a bounding box around\neach detected object. The easiest way to do this is to use a sliding window approach. Some\npointers to recent techniques in this area can be found in the workshop associated with the\nPASCAL VOC 2008 Challenge.\nEx 14.12: Part-based recognition\nChoose one or more of the techniques described in Sec-\ntion 14.4.2 and implement a part-based recognition system. Since these techniques are fairly\ninvolved, you will need to read several of the research papers in this area, select which gen-\neral approach you want to follow, and then implement your algorithm. A good starting point\ncould be the paper by Felzenszwalb, McAllester, and Ramanan (2008), since it performed\nwell in the PASCAL VOC 2008 detection challenge.\nEx 14.13: Recognition and segmentation\nChoose one or more of the techniques described\nin Section 14.4.3 and implement a simultaneous recognition and segmentation system. Since\nthese techniques are fairly involved, you will need to read several of the research papers in this\narea, select which general approach you want to follow, and then implement your algorithm.\nTest your algorithm on one or more of the segmentation databases in Table 14.2.\nEx 14.14: Context\nImplement one or more of the context and scene understanding sys-\ntems described in Section 14.5 and report on your experience. Does context or whole scene\nunderstanding perform better at naming objects than stand-alone systems?\n14.8 Exercises\n729\nEx 14.15: Tiny images\nDownload the tiny images database from http://people.csail.mit.\nedu/torralba/tinyimages/ and build a classiﬁer based on comparing your test images directly\nagainst all of the labeled training images. Does this seem like a promising approach?\n730\nComputer Vision: Algorithms and Applications (September 3, 2010 draft)",
